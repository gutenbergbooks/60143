<p>MISSION OF THE COLORADO GEOLOGICAL SURVEY</p>
<p>The Colorado Geological Survey was legislatively re-established
in February 1969 to meet the geologic needs of the citizens,
governmental agencies, and mineral industries of Colorado. This
modern legislation was aimed at applying geologic knowledge
toward the solution of today&rsquo;s and tomorrow&rsquo;s problems of an
expanding population, mounting environmental concern, and the
growing demand for mineral resources.</p>
<p>SPECIFIC LEGISLATIVE CHARGES:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>&ldquo;Assist, consult with, and advise state and local governmental agencies on geologic problems.&rdquo;</dt>
<dt>&ldquo;Promote economic development of mineral resources.&rdquo;</dt>
<dt>&ldquo;Evaluate the physical features of Colorado with reference to present and potential human and animal use.&rdquo;</dt>
<dt>&ldquo;Conduct studies to develop geologic information.&rdquo;</dt>
<dt>&ldquo;Inventory the state&rsquo;s mineral resources.&rdquo;</dt>
<dt>&ldquo;Collect, preserve and distribute geologic information.&rdquo;</dt>
<dt>&ldquo;Determine areas of geologic hazard that could affect the safety of or economic loss to the citizens of Colorado.&rdquo;</dt>
<dt>&ldquo;Prepare, publish, and distribute geologic reports, maps, and bulletins.&rdquo;</dt></dl>

<h3>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h3>
<p>This guidebook was written at the request of the Colorado
Geological Survey to fulfill a long-felt need for a popular
account of the state&rsquo;s geology and its relationship to Man.</p>
<p>The authors wish to thank those of their colleagues who have
assisted at various times in the preparation of this book. John
Rold, Colorado State Geologist, and William Weber, of the University
of Colorado Museum staff, made many helpful suggestions
concerning the manuscript. John Schooland, vice president of the
Colorado Historical Society, generously provided several pictures
of early mining activities in Colorado. Permission to reproduce
drawings and paintings of fossils and reconstructions of past
environments was granted by the American Museum of Natural
History and the University of Colorado Museum. Drawings, maps,
and diagrams are largely the work of Robert Maurer, who also
designed the cover and title page.</p>

<h1 title="">PRAIRIE PEAK and PLATEAU</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>Gold was discovered in the bed of the South Platte River in
1858. Prospectors flocked to Colorado as they had flocked
only a few years before to California. They worked the sands and
gravels of Cherry Creek, Clear Creek, Boulder Creek, and California
Gulch. Exhausting the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Placer">placer</a> sands of the stream bottoms,
they moved higher to mine gold-bearing <a class="gloss" href="#g_Vein">veins</a> at Central City and
Blackhawk. Mining camps sprang into existence overnight, each
heralding some new &ldquo;strike,&rdquo; each populated by a new rush of
fortune seekers. As lower areas were mined out, prospectors
moved yet higher&mdash;to Breckenridge, Gold Hill, and Empire,
Aspen, Leadville, and Cripple Creek. Silver was found as well as
gold, then iron, and later tungsten and molybdenum. The metallic
ring of mining tools echoed from Colorado&rsquo;s peaks. Fortunes
were made here. Legends were born.</p>
<p>Prospectors and miners were not, however, the first people
interested in the rocks of Colorado. Earlier, bands of nomadic
Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians had searched Colorado&rsquo;s hills
for flint for arrowheads and brightly colored clays for warpaint.
Cliff-dwelling Pueblo Indians in southwestern Colorado sought
clay for their pottery and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> seashells for the magic of their
medicine men. And from farther to the southwest, Navajo tribesmen
came to Colorado for turquoise.</p>
<p>From clay to gold, much of Colorado&rsquo;s wealth has come from
her mountains. But after the rush to the mines, as <a class="gloss" href="#g_Vein">veins</a> were
mined out and placers worked over, as values and prices changed,
her population sought the riches of the prairies: fertile lands for
agriculture, and in the rock layers below, black gold&mdash;vast
accumulations of oil and natural gas. The tablelands and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Plateau">plateaus</a>
west of the mountains yield their wealth, too. Here are valley
farms, fed often by irrigation water, and ranch country. Here is
more oil, and in some areas precious metals and uranium.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>In recent years Colorado&rsquo;s prairies, peaks, and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Plateau">plateaus</a> have
brought new meaning to all America: the state now provides an
attractive playground for state residents and their visitors. Campgrounds,
streams, lakes, and high trails beckon in summer; barren
slopes deep in winter snow attract the skier. More and more, those
who live in Colorado and those who visit her seek to understand
these mountains and hills and prairies, to learn of her geologic
origins and her far distant past. For tourist and resident, casual
visitor, ski enthusiast, Sunday picnicker, for all those who have
met Colorado and enjoyed her, this book is written.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">Colorado&rsquo;s Three Provinces</span></h2>
<p>Scenically, Colorado is divided into three provinces:
the Plains or Prairies on the east, the Rocky Mountains
bisecting the state from north to south, and the Colorado <a class="gloss" href="#g_Plateau">Plateaus</a>
on the west. There are a number of local variations of course, but
by and large the provinces are clearly defined. These three
divisions will form the basis for our discussion of the geology of
Colorado, for the scenic differences are almost exactly paralleled,
and usually controlled, by differences in geologic structure.</p>
<p>The Plains rise gently from an elevation of about 3350 feet
at the eastern border of the state to 5000 feet where they meet
the mountains 150 miles further west.</p>
<p>Two major rivers cross the Colorado Plains: the South Platte
River, flowing northeastward from the Denver region, and the
Arkansas River, which leaves the mountains at Canon City south
of Colorado Springs and travels eastward across the southern
portion of the state. Tributaries of these two main river systems
have etched the prairie surface, so that much of eastern Colorado
has a gently rolling, hilly appearance.</p>
<p>The Mountains rise abruptly along a north-south line at about
105&deg; west longitude. They reach elevations of over 14,000 feet
at Pikes Peak, Mount Evans, Longs Peak (all visible from far
out on the plains), and fifty other peaks further west. The ranges
of the Colorado Rockies form rank upon rank of ridges and peaks,
roughly north-south in trend, about 100 miles across from east
to west, extending from the northern to the southern border of
the state. Here, in mountain springs and lakes, are born the rivers
of Colorado: the Platte, the Arkansas, the Yampa, the Colorado.
Crags and cliffs tower above tree-covered slopes, the rocks always
a dominant part of the landscape. The continental divide runs
through the state along the summit ridges. West of the divide,
all streams flow to the Colorado River and the Pacific; east of it,
streams flow into the Mississippi or the Rio Grande, and thence
to the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>West of the highest ranges, the country flattens out once more
into the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Plateau">Plateaus</a>, which extend across western Colorado, southern
Utah, and northern Arizona. Here, the predominant land forms
are flat-topped <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesa">mesas</a> and deep canyons. Redrock walls shimmer
in the brilliance of the western sun, offset by deep purple shadows
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
sometimes hiding ancient cliff dwellings. Fragrance of pine and
juniper mingles with the pungency of sage. Narrow tracks lure
the explorer. Despite the canyons, water is scarce except along
major river systems, for this is the beginning of the desert west.</p>
<p>The scenic and geologic division of the state into three north-south
strips is not everywhere clearly defined. In southwestern
Colorado, the San Juan Mountains and the complicated uplifts
surrounding Ouray and Silverton are out of key with either
mountain or <a class="gloss" href="#g_Plateau">plateau</a>. They are best considered part of the Mountain
Province, however, although they extend it far to the west.
Other exceptions to these divisions occur also. The Mountain
Province is interrupted by four broad high-altitude valleys: North
Park, Middle Park, South Park, and the San Luis Valley. The
Uinta Mountains jut into the northwest corner of Colorado from
adjacent Utah. And the Paradox, Uinta, and Green River Basins
protrude into the Plateau Province, modifying its topographic
character.</p>

<p class="caption">Pikes Peak rises to an elevation at 14,110 feet. Composed of Pikes
Peak <a class="gloss" href="#g_Granite">Granite</a>, the mountain is almost surrounded by younger <a class="gloss" href="#g_SedimentaryRocks">sedimentary rocks</a>, including those of the Garden of the Gods, in the
foreground. (Floyd Walters photo)</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>Before discussing the geologic nature of the three provinces,
let us review briefly two sets of geologic terms. The first set has
to do with the rocks themselves&mdash;What kind of rock is that?&mdash;but
serves also to tell something about the origin of the rocks.
The second set is concerned with time&mdash;When was that rock
formed? Is it older or younger than adjacent rock? How does it
relate, time-wise, to geologic events in other parts of the world?</p>
<p>These two sets of terms are presented in the charts that follow.
If you are unfamiliar with geologic terminology, refer to these
charts as often as you need to while you read this book, as well as
to the glossary on pages <a href="#Page_114">114</a>-118.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Geologists divide rocks into three main groups, depending on their
modes of origin.</p>
<p><i><a class="gloss" href="#g_IgneousRocks">Igneous rocks</a></i> originate from molten material, cooling deep below
the surface of the earth (intrusive igneous rocks) or flowing out and
hardening at the surface (extrusive igneous rocks).</p>
<p><i><a class="gloss" href="#g_SedimentaryRocks">Sedimentary rocks</a></i> are formed from broken or dissolved bits of other
rock, washed by wind and water and deposited as layers of fragments
or as chemical precipitates. They often contain <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> plants or animals.</p>
<p><i>Metamorphic rocks</i> are pre-existing rocks (igneous or sedimentary)
changed by heat, pressure, or chemical action.</p>
<p>Examples of these three classes of rocks are given in the accompanying
figure. Many varieties of all three classes occur in Colorado.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>Geologists arrange rocks in their chronologic sequence by studying
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossils</a> and minerals which they contain. The age of some rocks
can be determined with reasonable precision from ratios of radioactive
minerals and their fission products. The relative age of others
can be determined from their position, the fossils enclosed in them,
and many minor details of their structure.</p>
<p>The <i>stratigraphic column</i> shown <a href="#fig4">opposite</a> may be thought of as a
calendar by which geologic events in Colorado can be arranged in
their proper order and related to events in the rest of the world.
Mississippian and Pennsylvanian Periods are American divisions;
elsewhere this time interval is known as the Carboniferous Period.
Other time terms are in worldwide use.</p>
<p>In the generalized geologic map of Colorado which accompanies
<a href="#c33">Chapter II</a>, rocks are identified by the era in which they were formed.
A more detailed geologic map can be obtained from the U.S. Geologic
Survey map distribution center in the Federal Building, Denver.</p>

<h3 id="c3">THE PRAIRIES</h3>
<p>Beneath the flat prairies of eastern Colorado, <a class="gloss" href="#g_SedimentaryRocks">sedimentary rocks</a> form a series of layers. Those near the surface are among
the youngest rocks in Colorado. We know this from the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossils</a>
they bear, fossils of large mammals such as the hairy mammoth,
which lived in early Quaternary time, the bison, and many smaller
mammals living today.</p>
<p>The layers below&mdash;sandstones, shales, and limestones&mdash;become
progressively older as one goes deeper. Most of them
were formed originally on the bottoms of shallow seas that covered
this part of North America several times during the history of the
continent. In most places the layers are horizontal or nearly so,
but westward, as they approach the mountains, they bend upward,
gently at first and then more steeply. At the very edge of the
mountains, where they were dragged upward when the mountains
rose, their eroded edges appear at the surface.</p>
<p>The entire sequence of flat-lying rocks can be studied where
they are exposed along the mountain front or where streams and
rivers have dissected them. They are also known from cuttings
and cores of oil and water wells. Some parts of Colorado&rsquo;s eastern
plains have been drilled so intensively in the search for oil and
gas that we know a great deal about the subsurface sedimentary rock and can even make maps showing the distribution and
character of the individual rock layers. From such maps, the
history of the region can be deduced. We know, for example,
that the area around Denver has subsided more in the past than
has the area near La Junta or Lamar; it is called the Denver
Basin because of its past history and not because it is a basin at
present.</p>
<p>Although the plains of Colorado appear flat, they really slope
gently eastward. The rock layers near the surface slope eastward
also, but the deeper rock layers may not.</p>
<p>Near the western edge of the Plains Province, hills and valleys
are formed by differential erosion of hard and soft rock layers.
Some hills, such as Castle Rock, are topped with resistant sandstone;
others, like <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesa">Mesa</a> de Maya south of Trinidad and Table
Mountain near Golden, are capped with layers of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Basalt">basalt</a>. Close to
the mountains flat-topped foothills result from partial dissection
of former erosion surfaces as the mountains, stabilized for a time,
rose again, or as climatic cycles changed. Examples of these
dissected erosion surfaces can be seen north and south of Boulder.</p>
<p>Far east of the mountain front, near the northern border of
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
Colorado, remnants of another, higher prairie surface stand as
Pawnee Buttes. Torrential erosion&mdash;spring floods and summer
thunderstorms&mdash;has deeply furrowed the prairie surface here and
left these buttes as lonely sentinels.</p>

<p class="caption">This map shows the distribution, character, and thickness of certain

<p>What lies below the sedimentary layers of the plains? The
<a class="gloss" href="#g_SedimentaryRocks">sedimentary rocks</a> are 5,000 to 10,000 feet thick. They lie on an
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
almost horizontal surface of much, much older rock, the Precambrian
or &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Basement">basement</a>&rdquo; rock. This is igneous and metamorphic rock,
much crumpled and folded, the roots of long gone mountains
which were beveled and leveled to an almost flat surface or
<i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Peneplain">peneplain</a></i> perhaps a billion years ago.</p>
<p>We know little of the ancient <a class="gloss" href="#g_Basement">basement</a> rocks below the
sedimentary layers of the plains, for few wells penetrate this deep.
What we do know indicates that they are similar to rocks of the
mountain masses to the west, and are composed of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Granite">granite</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Schist">schist</a>,
and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Gneiss">gneiss</a>. They probably are not rich in valuable minerals,
however, for the mineral-rich <a class="gloss" href="#g_Vein">veins</a> of the mountains came about
as a result of uplift of the mountain areas.</p>
<h3 id="c4">THE PEAKS</h3>
<p>Most of the individual ranges making up the Rocky Mountains
in Colorado are the result of highly localized movements of the
crust as the entire region was thrust upward from below. These
movements broke the deep, massive igneous and metamorphic rocks of the Precambrian <a class="gloss" href="#g_Basement">basement</a>, and bent the more flexible
Paleozoic and Mesozoic layered rocks above them until they
arched upward in a series of corrugations. The mountains thus
formed are known to geologists as <i>faulted <a class="gloss" href="#g_Anticline">anticlines</a></i>.</p>
<p>As the mountains rose, they were of course attacked by the
forces of erosion. The sedimentary layers were completely stripped
from the crests of many of the uplifts, so that Precambrian rocks
were exposed. It is these rocks which form the summits of the
highest peaks of Colorado. As with all rules, there are exceptions:
the Spanish Peaks are volcanic, and the crest of the Sangre de
Cristo Range is composed of <a class="gloss" href="#g_SedimentaryRocks">sedimentary rocks</a>.</p>
<p>The trend of most of the ranges in Colorado is north-south,
swinging to northwest-southeast near the southern end. Surprisingly,
in the northwestern corner of the state there is an east-west
trending range, the Uinta Mountains.</p>
<p>Fifty or more mountain ridges in Colorado have been named
as separate ranges. Of these, the most prominent, frequently visited
ones will be discussed here.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h3 id="c5">Front Range</h3>
<p>The easternmost range of the Rocky Mountains is the longest
continuous uplift in the state. It is a relatively simple faulted
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Anticline">anticline</a> extending from Canon City northward to the Wyoming
border, where it splits into two ridges, the Medicine Bow Mountains
and the Laramie Range.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig6">

<p class="caption">Longs Peak challenges technical climbers with its 2000-foot vertical

that remains of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Glacier">glacier</a>. The flat summit may be part of an ancient
erosion surface formed toward the end of Precambrian time. (Jack

</div>
<p>Along the highest portion of the range, from Pikes Peak to
Rocky Mountain National Park, the Paleozoic and Mesozoic
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
sediments formerly draped over the top of the range have long
since been washed away, leaving only the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Gneiss">gneiss</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Granite">granite</a>, and
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Schist">schist</a> of the mountain core. The almost flat tops of Longs Peak,
Mt. Evans, and Pikes Peak, and the rolling upland traversed by
Trail Ridge Road in Rocky Mountain National Park are thought
to be remnants of the 600-million-year-old erosion surface that
once existed at the top of the Precambrian rocks, and that still
exists below the <a class="gloss" href="#g_SedimentaryRocks">sedimentary rocks</a> of the Plains Province. This
surface, formed near sea level, has been raised 12,000 to 14,000
feet within the Mountain Province.</p>
<p>Throughout most of its length, the Front Range displays
some of the most striking high-altitude scenery in the world.
Particularly accessible areas, well worthy of visits, are Rocky
Mountain National Park, Berthoud and Loveland Passes, Mt.
Evans, and Pikes Peak. In these areas the Precambrian rocks can
be seen and studied, and the effects of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Glaciation">glaciation</a> observed.</p>
<p>The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Granite">granite</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Gneiss">gneiss</a>, and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Schist">schist</a> of the mountain core are shattered
and broken into blocks of various sizes. The breaks between
the blocks are called <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Joint">joints</a></i> if there is no apparent displacement
between adjacent blocks, and <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Fault">faults</a></i> where there is obvious
displacement. The joints frequently appear in parallel arrays or
sets; there may be two or more intersecting sets, giving a cross-hatched
appearance to large exposures.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>The Precambrian rocks vary from place to place. Several
irregular masses of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Granite">granite</a>, called <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Batholith">batholiths</a></i>, make up portions
of the range. Batholiths are large intrusions of molten rock that
cooled slowly at great depth. The minerals in them form distinct
crystals, often quite large. The Pikes Peak Granite and the Boulder
Creek Granite are examples. Highly contorted and banded <a class="gloss" href="#g_Gneiss">gneiss</a>
and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Schist">schist</a> are well exposed elsewhere, particularly in the Idaho
Springs-Central City-Black Hawk region.</p>
<p>Along the flanks of the Front Range, the eroded edges of
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_SedimentaryRocks">sedimentary rocks</a> which once covered the range are exposed.
These rocks are usually tilted sharply against the mountains, as
at Garden of the Gods, Denver&rsquo;s Red Rocks Park, and the
Flatirons near Boulder. The Rocky Mountain Association of
Geologists has erected a plaque explaining the geology of the
Red Rocks area; look for it about half a mile northeast of the
Red Rocks Amphitheater. Tilted layers of Paleozoic and Mesozoic
sandstones form <a class="gloss" href="#g_Hogback">hogback</a> ridges along the mountain front, and
stand out clearly on aerial photographs.</p>
<p>In some areas, particularly near Boulder, Coal Creek, and
Golden, the tilting of the sedimentary layers has been so extreme
that the layers are upside down. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Basement">Basement</a> rocks may even be
thrust out above them.</p>

</div>
<p>Further north, near Loveland and Lyons, as well as further
south at Colorado Springs, irregularities in the uplift have caused
abrupt breaks in the generally smooth eastern edge of the range.
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Fold">Folds</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fault">faults</a> in these areas trend northwest, cutting across and
offsetting the mountain front.</p>

<p>The west margin of the Front Range is not as sharply defined
as the eastern margin. Prominent <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fault">faults</a> edge North, Middle, and
South Parks, however. The northern end of the range merges with
the Medicine Bow Mountains, where <a class="gloss" href="#g_Dip">dips</a> of sedimentary rocks
seldom exceed 30 to 40 degrees. At its southern end, the Front
Range plunges into the plains, although a southwest-trending
ridge connects it with the Wet Mountains.</p>
<p>Within the Precambrian core of the Front Range, many
economic mineral deposits have been found. These are discussed
in <a href="#c33">Chapter III</a>. Glacial features of the Front Range are discussed
in Chapter II in the section on the <a href="#c32">Quaternary Period</a>.</p>
<h3 id="c6">Wet Mountains</h3>
<p>The Wet Mountains are the easternmost range of the Rockies
south of Canon City. Their crest has a distinct northwest-southeast
trend, with the north end offset about 25 miles westward
from the south end of the Front Range. The Canon City
Embayment lies at the junction between the ranges.</p>
<p>Though smaller and lower than the Front Range, the Wet
Mountains include many pleasant and easily accessible recreation
areas and a number of attractive streams and reservoirs. Greenhorn
Peak, the summit of the range, is 12,334 feet high. It is formed
of Precambrian <a class="gloss" href="#g_Granite">granite</a>, as is most of the crest of the range.</p>
<p>The structure of the eastern side of the Wet Mountains is
similar to that of the Front Range, except that there are more
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Fault">faults</a> in the sedimentary layers. The southern end plunges southeastward
into the plains. On the western side, westward-dipping
sediments are completely submerged in Cenozoic <a class="gloss" href="#g_Lava">lava</a> flows and
debris from the mountains. Ore minerals very like those of the
Front Range occur near Silver Cliff, but they have so far proved
to be of little economic importance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h3 id="c7">Sangre de Cristo Range and Spanish Peaks</h3>
<p>The Sangre de Cristo Mountains are visible from many parts
of southeastern Colorado as a jagged, sawtoothed, snow-crested
ridge on the western skyline. They extend about 150 miles from
the Arkansas River near Salida southward into New Mexico.</p>
<p>Few mountain ranges form so impassable a barrier as the
Sangre de Cristos. Only at La Veta Pass does a highway cross the
range. However, old wagon roads, passable now by jeep or on foot,
once existed across Hayden, Music, Mosca, and Whiskey Creek
Passes.</p>
<p>Often no more than twenty miles wide, the central portion of
the range is composed largely of red Late Paleozoic sediments
like those exposed in the Garden of the Gods and Red Rocks
Park. These rocks are intricately folded and faulted, but not
metamorphosed. They include sandstones, shale, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Conglomerate">conglomerates</a>,
and fossil-bearing limestones. The northern end of the range is
formed of Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rocks.</p>
<p>Just west of La Veta Pass, Sierra Blanca stands as an outpost
of the range where its continuity is interrupted and its structure
changed. Huge blocks of Precambrian <a class="gloss" href="#g_Granite">granite</a> were here pushed
upward and thrust westward to form a cluster of peaks, several
of which are over 14,000 feet in elevation.</p>
<p>Many prominent rock <a class="gloss" href="#g_Glacier">glaciers</a> are present in the Sangre de
Cristo Mountains. They are composed of fragments of rock,
lubricated by snow and ice, creeping almost imperceptibly down
the steep flanks of the high peaks. One of these rock glaciers can
be seen on the slope of Mt. Mestas east of La Veta Pass; others
are visible from Great Sand Dunes National Monument.</p>
<p>South of La Veta Pass, an igneous intrusion along the axis
of the range changes the character of the Sangre de Cristos. This
intrusion is harder and has weathered more slowly than the rest
of the range, and forms a group of prominent peaks known as the
Culebra Range.</p>
<p>On the west flank of the Sangre de Cristo Range, east of Villa
Grove, a prominent iron-mineralized area can be seen. Here the
ghost mine of Orient marks the site where iron ores were mined
in the early days of the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company.
Nearby, an abrupt terrace along the edge of the valley marks the
position of a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fault">fault</a>. Recent gravels are involved in this fault, indicating
that movement has taken place here within the last few
hundred years. A number of hot springs occur along the base of
the mountains nearby.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>The Spanish Peaks, not structurally related to the Sangre de
Cristos, are visible from La Veta Pass highway. These two peaks
represent a pair of Cenozoic volcanoes, now deeply eroded and
much reduced from their former height. Numerous <a class="gloss" href="#g_Dike">dikes</a> radiating
from the bases of these peaks represent fissures which were filled
with <a class="gloss" href="#g_Lava">lava</a> as the peaks formed.</p>
<p>The Great Sand Dunes, close to the Sangre de Cristo Mountains
north of Sierra Blanca, are discussed in Chapter II in the
section on the <a href="#c32">Quaternary Period</a>.</p>

<h3 id="c8">Park Range and Rabbit Ears Range</h3>
<p>Bordering the western side of North, Middle, and South Parks,
another long north-south trending ridge extends from the Wyoming
border toward the center of Colorado. The northern part of this
ridge, forming the western boundary of the main mountain mass
in the state, is called the Park Range.</p>
<p>The structure of the Park Range is similar to that of the
Front Range: a huge linear corrugation in the earth&rsquo;s crust,
bounded by <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fault">faults</a>. Because this area has fewer resistant sedimentary rock layers above the Precambrian <a class="gloss" href="#g_Basement">basement</a> rocks, it is not
prominently edged with upturned sedimentary layers.</p>

<p>The range is crossed by Rabbit Ears Pass in the north; Gore
Pass near Kremmling marks its southern end. Mt. Zirkel (12,180
feet) and Flattop Mountain (12,118 feet) are the two high points
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
of the range; these and a number of unnamed peaks over 11,000
feet high are upward-faulted blocks of Precambrian <a class="gloss" href="#g_Granite">granite</a>.</p>
<p>A rough ridge of volcanic country joins the Park Range with
the Front Range and effectively separates North Park and Middle
Park. This is the Rabbit Ears Range, named for a double-eared
knob of Precambrian <a class="gloss" href="#g_Granite">granite</a> near Rabbit Ears Pass on U. S.
highway 40. Many Tertiary volcanic features, including <a class="gloss" href="#g_Dike">dikes</a>
and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Lava">lava</a> flows, can be seen along this ridge, which is also traversed
by Colorado state highway 125 between Granby and Walden via
Willow Creek Pass.</p>
<h3 id="c9">Gore Range</h3>
<p>The Gore Range lies south of Gore Pass, along the Park
Range trend. The ridge of this range is low for about 15 miles
south of Kremmling, but the southern part of the range forms a
spectacular high cluster of peaks with many relatively inaccessible
and rugged summits. Many of the peaks in this remote country
are as yet unnamed; the area has been set aside as the Gore
Range-Eagle&rsquo;s Nest Wilderness Area. The Colorado River cuts
directly across the northern part of the Gore Range just west of
Kremmling, in a steep-walled canyon that is one of the wild scenic
spots of Colorado.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig14">

</div>
<p>The Gore Range is, like the Front Range, a faulted <a class="gloss" href="#g_Anticline">anticline</a>
with Precambrian rocks at its core. The red <a class="gloss" href="#g_SedimentaryRocks">sedimentary rocks</a>
on the west flank of the range, visible at Vail Pass and Vail ski
area, are of the same age as those in Red Rocks Park near Denver
and the Garden of the Gods near Colorado Springs. Paleozoic
rocks are absent on the east flank of the range, having been eroded
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
from that area before Mesozoic deposition. South of the Colorado
River and north of the Wilderness Area, Mesozoic rocks extend
over the crest of the range.</p>
<p>The south end of the Gore Range is marked by Tenmile Gorge
(U. S. highway 6 between Frisco and Vail Pass). This gorge is a
glacial valley, carved during the Ice Age by a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Glacier">glacier</a> more than
1,000 feet thick, along a weak faulted zone in the range. A <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fault">fault</a>
surface can be seen on the east side of the valley.</p>
<p>From Vail Pass, or from the top of the Vail ski lift, other
evidences of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Glaciation">glaciation</a> can be seen&mdash;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Cirque">cirques</a> and U-shaped
valleys&mdash;testifying to the former presence here of many large
valley <a class="gloss" href="#g_Glacier">glaciers</a>.</p>
<h3 id="c10">Tenmile and Mosquito Ranges</h3>
<p>With scarcely a break, the Park Range-Gore Range structure
continues southward into the Tenmile and Mosquito Ranges.
These high ridges separate South Park from the upper Arkansas
Valley, and include a cluster of very high peaks, Quandary, Mt.
Lincoln, Mt. Democrat, and Mt. Bross, all over 14,000 feet in
elevation.</p>
<p>Structurally, both the Tenmile Range and the Mosquito Range
are highly asymmetrical <a class="gloss" href="#g_Anticline">anticlines</a>, gentle on the east and steeply
faulted on the west. Paleozoic sedimentary rock layers containing
many <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossils</a> cover large portions of the higher parts of these
ranges, but two of the highest peaks, Mt. Bross and Mt. Lincoln,
are capped by the Lincoln <a class="gloss" href="#g_Porphyry">Porphyry</a>, a Tertiary intrusive, while
Quandary Peak is Precambrian <a class="gloss" href="#g_Granite">granite</a>.</p>
<p>These mountains are highly mineralized, and have been
extensively explored and mined. The Climax Molybdenum
Corporation operates an especially large mine at Climax, and
the New Jersey Zinc Company has a large underground mine and
mill at Gilman, on the western slopes of Tenmile Range.</p>
<p>Buffalo Peaks, two highly eroded volcanic mountains near the
south end of Mosquito Range, are extrusions of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Lava">lava</a> and ash
which have buried the axis of the Mosquito uplift. They are major
volcanoes related to a group of small volcanic cones near Antero
Junction, in South Park.</p>
<p>South of Buffalo Peaks, near Trout Creek Pass, the Mosquito
Range loses altitude rapidly and merges with the rough country
called the Arkansas Hills. Cinder cones, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Dike">dikes</a>, and other evidences
of Tertiary volcanic activity can be seen between Trout Creek
Pass and Salida.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<h3 id="c11">Sawatch Range</h3>
<p>Bordering the Arkansas River valley on the west, the Sawatch
Range includes Colorado&rsquo;s highest mountain, Mt. Elbert (14,417
feet). With several other 14,000-foot summits, this range is the
highest in the state. One group of peaks, known as the Collegiate
Range (Mts. Harvard, Yale, Columbia, and Princeton) forms
a particularly imposing vista from U. S. highway 24 between
Trout Creek Pass and Buena Vista. The Independence Pass
highway (Colorado 82) between Leadville and Aspen penetrates
the heart of the Sawatch high country.</p>
<p>The Sawatch Range as a whole is about 100 miles long (north
to south) and 40 miles wide. It is a great faulted <a class="gloss" href="#g_Anticline">anticline</a> intruded
by <a class="gloss" href="#g_IgneousRocks">igneous rocks</a>. The high area north of Leadville shows that the
Sawatch and Mosquito Ranges are in reality one huge <a class="gloss" href="#g_Dome">dome</a> with
a slight sag in the middle. The ranges, though, are sharply separated
topographically by the deep valley of the Arkansas River.
Precambrian rocks are near the surface between the ranges, hidden
only by a thin cover of stream gravels. Near Leadville, some
complexly faulted Paleozoic limestones lie in the sag between the
ranges.</p>
<p>At Mt. Princeton Hot Springs there is evidence of repeated
faulting and igneous activity. The rocks are strongly altered by
hot water coming to the surface through fissures and cracks.</p>
<p>On the west side of the Sawatch range, the old mining towns
of Tincup and Aspen grew up where limestone and sandstone
layers, broken and crumpled as the Sawatch Range rose, were
mineralized by solutions rich in gold and silver. The Aspen
Mining District was studied extensively by geologists of the U.S.
Geological Survey, and their maps show almost unbelievable
complexity in the faulting of the rock layers which exist there.</p>
<p>The north end of the Sawatch Range plunges under shales
and sandstones along the Eagle River east of Wolcott. Gypsum
in the sediments here has acted like putty: the layers of rock in
which it was deposited have become peculiarly crumpled, making
the area along the Eagle River (visible from U. S. Interstate 70)
between Avon and Edwards hummocky and irregular. Vegetation
is unusually sparse here because of gypsum in the soil.</p>
<p>About midway between Edwards and Wolcott, the Eagle
River suddenly changes direction and flows northward for about
a mile before resuming its former westward course. This sudden
change is caused by a sharp north-south <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fold">fold</a> in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_SedimentaryRocks">sedimentary rocks</a> on the northwestern flank of the Sawatch Range. A magnificent
series of roadcut and hillside exposures along the highway
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
here illustrates the close relation between rock layers and river
course. Within about a mile, the highway cuts through rocks of
Pennsylanian, Permian, Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous age,
spanning a geologic time interval of more than 200 million years.</p>
<p>The south end of the Sawatch Range, at Monarch Pass,
contains steeply dipping Late Paleozoic limestones and coal beds.
The coal has been mined on a small scale; the limestone is now
quarried for use as a flux in iron smelters at Pueblo.</p>

<h3 id="c12">Elk Mountains and West Elk Mountains</h3>
<p>The Elk Mountains and West Elk Mountains appear to be
westward continuations of the Sawatch Range. Structurally, however,
they are not faulted <a class="gloss" href="#g_Anticline">anticlines</a> like most of the other ranges
in Colorado, but are composed of a series of layers of Paleozoic
sediments thrust westward over one another. These rocks, often
crumpled and highly metamorphosed, are cut by numerous sills,
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Dike">dikes</a>, and other intrusions, many of which have caused mineral
enrichment locally.</p>
<p>At Maroon Bells, in the canyon of Maroon Creek, and at
Redstone on the Crystal River, these metamorphosed sediments
are well exposed. Here, red sandstones and shales have been
altered to quartzites and slate. At Marble, metamorphism of a
thick limestone bed has produced white marble of great beauty,
known as Yule Marble. This decorative stone was quarried extensively
until about 1940. It was used in the Lincoln Memorial and
several other monumental structures; in the town of Marble it
has been used for the doorsteps of log cabins! The largest block
quarried, for the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington
National Cemetery, measured 14 by 7.4 by 6 feet in the rough,
and weighed 56 tons.</p>

<p>Crested Butte, at the south end of the Elk Mountains, is a
small intrusive igneous mass called a <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Laccolith">laccolith</a></i>. Hard and resistant

<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<h3 id="c13">San Juan Mountains</h3>
<p>The San Juan Mountains are the most extensive range in
Colorado, and also the most heterogeneous. Covering more than
10,000 square miles of the southwestern part of the state, these
mountains are formed mostly of Tertiary volcanic rocks, the result
of repeated outpourings of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Lava">lava</a> and ash from a cluster of volcanoes.
Water-laid gravels composed of volcanic sand and pebbles are
interlayered with <a class="gloss" href="#g_Basalt">basalts</a> and ash beds; the total thickness of these
beds reaches many thousands of feet.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig17">

swimming pool. Gold, silver, lead, and zinc are still mined in this
area. (Jack Rathbone photo)</p>
</div>
<p>The widespread volcanic activity which formed most of the
range began in mid-Tertiary time and continued for several million
years. A few Quaternary volcanic flows are known in the region,
but there is no active volcanism there at present.</p>
<p>The western side of the main range, including some of the
highest peaks, consists primarily of uplifted and faulted Paleozoic
sedimentary layers. These layers, highly dissected by erosion, can
be seen near Ouray, at Molas Lake, and at Durango. Large
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
patches of Precambrian <a class="gloss" href="#g_Granite">granite</a> and metamorphic rocks protrude
through the sediments, as in the Needle Mountains; they indicate
that this part of the range is a faulted <a class="gloss" href="#g_Anticline">anticline</a> like many other
Colorado ranges.</p>
<p>Early Cenozoic glacial deposits occur in some parts of the
San Juans. These are unusual features, as <a class="gloss" href="#g_Glaciation">glaciation</a> of this age is
unknown elsewhere in Colorado.</p>
<p>Three small ranges rise just west of the San Juans: the San
Miguel, Rico, and La Plata Mountains. Each consists of several
small masses of Tertiary igneous rock intruded into Paleozoic
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Conglomerate">conglomerates</a>, shales, and limestones.</p>
<p>Mineralization has been intense in the San Juans; most of it
took place during the Late Tertiary volcanic period. Rich <a class="gloss" href="#g_Vein">veins</a>
penetrate Precambrian <a class="gloss" href="#g_Gneiss">gneiss</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Granite">granite</a>, and Paleozoic limestones
are often enriched also. Several mines are still active near
Ouray, Silverton, Telluride, and Rico.</p>
<h3 id="c14">Uinta Mountains</h3>
<p>The eastern end of Utah&rsquo;s Uinta Mountains extends into
Colorado. Unlike other ranges in Colorado, these mountains trend
east-west. Structurally, the range is a faulted <a class="gloss" href="#g_Anticline">anticline</a>. It is quite
asymmetrical, however, and is tilted and folded upward on the
south, and overturned or thrust-faulted on the north. Steeply
dipping Mesozoic and Paleozoic sediments on the south side of
the range, sparsely vegetated and often thrown into spectacular
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Fold">folds</a>, are a prominent feature of northwest Colorado scenery.</p>
<p>In Colorado the crest of the Uintas reaches an elevation of
about 8,500 feet. It consists of Precambrian rocks, but these are
not the igneous and metamorphic rocks that characterize the
Precambrian core of other Colorado mountains. They are easily
recognized as sediments&mdash;dark red <a class="gloss" href="#g_Conglomerate">conglomerates</a>, sandstones,
and mudstones&mdash;virtually unmetamorphosed though they were
deposited nearly a billion years ago. Called the Uinta Mountain
Formation, these rocks are found only in this part of Colorado
and adjacent areas of Utah. They are probably related to similar
Precambrian rocks found in Montana and Canada.</p>
<p>At the east end of the Uintas two isolated uplifts, Cross
Mountain and Juniper Mountain, are faulted blocks of Paleozoic
rocks standing like islands in a sea of Cenozoic valley fill. They
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
are the last outposts of the Uinta anticlinal pattern as it wanes
toward the southeast.</p>
<p>Dinosaur National Monument, a Uinta Mountain tourist attraction,
encompasses a vast area of wilderness on both sides of the
Yampa River in Colorado. Here many of the features of the east
end of the Uinta Mountain structure can be seen. A unique display
of the world&rsquo;s largest <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossils</a> can be visited in the Utah portion of
the Monument.</p>

<h3 id="c15">THE <a class="gloss" href="#g_Plateau">PLATEAUS</a></h3>
<p>The western quarter of Colorado is a region of flat-lying
Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic <a class="gloss" href="#g_SedimentaryRocks">sedimentary rocks</a> which have
not been bent up into mountains except in a few isolated instances.
This area lies more than a mile above sea level, however, and
because of the gradient such an elevation affords, it is deeply
sculptured. The Colorado River and its tributaries have sliced into
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Plateau">plateau</a> surface, separating it into many isolated tablelands
or <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesa">mesas</a>. Some are capped with sedimentary rock, others with
Tertiary <a class="gloss" href="#g_Basalt">basalt</a>.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig19">
<img src="images/p16.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="623" />
<p class="caption">The Grand <a class="gloss" href="#g_Hogback">Hogback</a> is a good example of the type of geologic
structure known as a <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Monocline">monocline</a></i>. The hogback ridge is formed by
differential erosion, where soft layers wear away more easily than
hard layers.</p>
</div>
<p>Simple <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fold">folds</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fault">faults</a> have given the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesa">mesas</a> different elevations.
Thus the average elevation of the White River <a class="gloss" href="#g_Plateau">Plateau</a> is
11,000 feet, that of the Roan Plateau 9,500 feet, and that of
Mesa Verde only 7,000 feet. West of Durango the plateaus <a class="gloss" href="#g_Dip">dip</a>
gently southward, as can be seen at Mesa Verde. Igneous intrusions
and extrusions have altered plateau topography in some
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
areas. West of Mesa Verde, for instance, an intrusive <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stock">stock</a> forms
a prominent <a class="gloss" href="#g_Dome">dome</a> in the Southern Ute Indian Reservation.</p>
<p>West of the northern Colorado mountains, and north and
west of the White River <a class="gloss" href="#g_Plateau">Plateau</a>, a rolling upland extends from
Colorado into Utah and Wyoming. It is interrupted by the Uinta
Mountains and a number of smaller related uplifts such as Juniper
Mountain and Cross Mountain. South of the Uinta axis the area
is known as the Uinta Basin.</p>
<p>The northern part of this area is structurally the south edge
of the Green River or Washakie Basin in Wyoming. The Rangely
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Anticline">anticline</a>, in the northeastern corner of the Uinta Basin, is one
of Colorado&rsquo;s richest oil fields; it is discussed in <a href="#c33">Chapter III</a>.</p>
<p>Although surfaced with much younger sediments than the
rest of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Plateau">Plateau</a> Province, this area is structurally similar.
On the whole, sedimentary layers are relatively flat-lying, and
where they are uplifted they are deeply sculptured by streams and
rivers. The <a class="gloss" href="#g_SedimentaryRocks">sedimentary rocks</a> in this region contain uranium and
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Placer">placer</a> gold in addition to great oil and gas deposits. The southeastern
part of the Uinta Basin, usually called the Piceance Basin,
is the site of a great deposit of oil shale (see <a href="#c33">Chapter III</a>). The
term &ldquo;basin&rdquo; may here seem unusual to the casual observer, for
the oil shales occur on the Roan Plateau at places well over
10,000 feet in elevation. However, the entire region was basin-like&mdash;lower
than the surrounding ranges&mdash;for many millions
of years, and during Tertiary time thousands of feet of valley and
lake deposits were laid down in it.</p>
<p>The White River <a class="gloss" href="#g_Plateau">Plateau</a>, north of Glenwood Springs, is
composed of almost horizontal Paleozoic <a class="gloss" href="#g_SedimentaryRocks">sedimentary rocks</a> that
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Fold">fold</a> downward sharply along its south and west edges. The fold
is 135 miles long and is clearly marked by the Grand <a class="gloss" href="#g_Hogback">Hogback</a>,
the eroded edge of hard Cretaceous and early Cenozoic rock
layers. Shale and coaly layers involved in the same fold have
eroded more readily, leaving the resistant sandstone as a prominent
ridge.</p>
<p>The Uncompahgre <a class="gloss" href="#g_Plateau">Plateau</a>, southwest of Grand Junction, is
structurally very like the White River Plateau. Its features can be
well observed in Colorado National Monument. It has been elevated
several thousand feet more than the Book Cliffs and Grand
Valley areas to the north. Sharp folding and faulting near the
Colorado River at the north boundary of the National Monument
show that differential movement between the two regions was
sharp and localized.</p>
<p>A series of northwest-trending <a class="gloss" href="#g_Anticline">anticlines</a> along the Utah border
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
in southwestern Colorado are of special geologic interest. They
represent peculiar structures in which salt and gypsum have
played a major part. These minerals were deposited in thick
layers late in Paleozoic time; subsequently they were covered by
thousands of feet of sand, shale, and limestone. Because of their
low density and high plasticity they have since crept upward
along weak spots in the overlying sediments, often contorting
these rocks as they moved. Breaking through to the surface, the
salt and some of the gypsum washed away more rapidly than
the surrounding rock, leaving long faulted troughs such as Gypsum
Valley and Paradox Valley. In most of these structures the
gypsum can still be seen, although the more soluble salt has
eroded away. Oil wells in this part of Colorado and in adjacent
parts of southeast Utah have penetrated thousands of feet of
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Evaporite">evaporites</a>, including pure salt, gypsum, and potassium salts.</p>

<p>The peculiar weathering characteristics of flat-lying <a class="gloss" href="#g_SedimentaryRocks">sedimentary rocks</a> in an arid climate are well demonstrated in Colorado
National Monument, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesa">Mesa</a> Verde National Park, and elsewhere
in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Plateau">Plateau</a> Province. Those fortunate enough to make a river
trip through the Yampa or Green River Canyons in northwestern
Colorado or on the rivers of eastern Utah and northern Arizona
will have an unusually fine opportunity to observe close at hand
the weathering and erosion in this area. Resistant sandstone and
limestone layers break into sheer cliffs, often many hundreds of
feet high, while the softer layers of mudstone and shale form gentle
slopes and terraces. Vast arching caves often develop where resistant
layers are undermined&mdash;caves sometimes containing ancient
Indian dwellings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Geologic History of Colorado</span></h2>
<p>Astronomical and geologic evidence indicates that the
earth was probably formed as an immense blob of molten
rock, held together and shaped into spherical form by its own
gravity. It may even have been gaseous at first, cooling gradually
to a molten state. After hundreds of millions of years it became
cool enough to begin to harden.</p>
<p>As the surface cooled, a crust formed, and lay like a blanket
over the liquid mass beneath. Convection currents&mdash;large-scale
boiling movements&mdash;stirred the molten interior, thrust portions
of the crust upward, and sucked other portions downward to be
remelted. Some of the lighter components, such as compounds
of silicon and oxygen and hydrogen, accumulated on the surface
like froth on a kettle: the continents were born. With further
cooling the atmosphere and oceans came into being.</p>
<p>Something can be told of the age of the continents. Measurements
of radioactivity in the most ancient rocks exposed at the
surface today indicate that the oldest known continental rock is
between three and four billion years old. Since the continents
were formed, they have been bent and shifted and broken by the
pressures exerted against them by convection in the interior.
Parts of the continents at times have been submerged below the
level of the sea, even as they are today. Other portions, lifted
above sea level, were immediately attacked by the wearing-down
processes of erosion. The battle between mountain-building forces
and erosion has been a continuous one ever since the crust was
formed. Even now earthquakes give testimony to continued crustal
movement, storms still sweep across the continents and wash mud
and frost-loosened rocks into churning torrents, rivers still deposit
great floodplains and deltas, sediments accumulate slowly but
persistently upon the bottoms of the seas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<h3 id="c17">PRECAMBRIAN ERA</h3>
<p>Only part of the earth&rsquo;s very early history is represented in
Colorado, where the oldest known rocks are the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Gneiss">gneisses</a> and
schists of the Idaho Springs Formation, at least 1,800,000,000
years old. These rocks appear to be the remains of ancient sediments,
folded and metamorphosed into vast mountain areas long
before recognizable life inhabited the earth.</p>
<p>Precambrian rocks in Colorado are on the whole very poorly
known. They have, however, been studied in detail in the Front
Range west of Denver and Boulder, where they have been intensively
explored for valuable minerals. The lack of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossils</a> in the
oldest rocks makes their close correlation difficult, but from
studies of radioactive minerals contained in these rocks, and of the
relationships of the rock units themselves, we can list them in
order of their relative ages.</p>
<p>Note that the rock sequence given below reads chronologically
from bottom to top&mdash;a logical pattern in geology since younger
rocks, especially those of sedimentary origin, normally lie above
older ones. Recent studies indicate that the sequence may be
much more complex than shown here.</p>
<table class="center">
<tr><td class="r">(youngest) Silver Plume <a class="gloss" href="#g_Granite">Granite</a>: </td><td class="l">light pinkish gray, fine-grained granite.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="r">Pikes Peak Granite: </td><td class="l">pink, coarse-grained granite.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="r">Boulder Creek Granite: </td><td class="l">dark gray, faintly banded granodiorite.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="r">Coal Creek Quartzite: </td><td class="l">light gray quartzite with grains ranging in size from fine sand to boulders, with some interbedded <a class="gloss" href="#g_Schist">schist</a>.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="r">(oldest) Idaho Springs Formation: </td><td class="l">gray to black schist and gneiss.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>From a sequence such as this, it is possible to reconstruct
some features of Colorado&rsquo;s early history. The first chapter of
which we have a record is the deposition of the Idaho Springs
Formation, probably as an accumulation of mud, sand, and limy
mud in an ancient sea. Swandyke deposition followed&mdash;the
sediments were iron-rich, perhaps derived from ancient volcanic
materials. The original Coal Creek sediments were sands and
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
gravels, some of them quite coarse and therefore indicative of
near-shore deposition. The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Schist">schist</a> layers suggest that muds must
have been deposited also.</p>

<p class="caption">South of Ouray, Cambrian sandstones of the Sawatch Formation lie

</div>
<p>Together these three formations represent some 40,000 feet
of sedimentary layers. Deposition of such a great thickness of mud,
sand, and lime must have taken a very long period of time.
Details of the geography of the continent during that period have
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
of course been obscured by later events, when these rocks were
subjected to repeated uplift, crumpling, folding, various degrees
of remelting and recrystallization, and erosion. But the ancient
sediments must have been derived from even more ancient highlands,
either folded and faulted mountains or volcanoes, and
probably were deposited under water in broad expanses of sea
that covered portions of the continent.</p>

<p>The Boulder Creek, Pikes Peak, and Silver Plume <a class="gloss" href="#g_Granite">Granites</a>
cut through the metamorphic rocks, and are therefore younger.
They represent pulses of molten rock forced upward from deep
within the crust, probably during three separate episodes of mountain
building. As each set of mountains was formed, it was worn
down, perhaps to low rolling hills, perhaps to flat plains almost
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
at sea level, and partially or entirely covered with thick layers of
sediment. Each time, another mountain building episode followed,
with new intrusions of granite and new metamorphism of the
pre-existing rocks.</p>
<p>Each succeeding period of metamorphism and mountain
building further changed the nature of the rocks involved, complicating
the patterns of folding and faulting, adding recrystallization
to recrystallization, until the oldest of the rocks bore little trace
of their original sedimentary nature. In general, the rocks that
are oldest were most altered by the repeated metamorphism, while
the younger rocks were less altered.</p>

</div>
<p>The Precambrian Era ended with a long period of erosion, a
period known to geologists as the Lipalian Interval. During this
time, over almost the entire world there was no mountain building.
The land lay sleeping, subject only to the forces of erosion. The
last mountains were flattened nearly to sea level. Slow, sluggish
streams and rivers carried sand and mud toward the oceans&mdash;oceans
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
in which perhaps primitive, soft-bodied organisms, with
no hard parts to be preserved as <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossils</a>, were beginning to evolve.</p>
<p>On the continents, the time of intense metamorphism was
over; most rocks of later eras are preserved today in pretty much
their original state. The boundary between the Precambrian and
later rocks is normally well defined. It is visible at many places in
Colorado: in Williams Canyon near Colorado Springs, in Glenwood
Canyon, near Red Rocks west of Denver, just west of
La Veta Pass, at the top of Royal Gorge and the Black Canyon
of the Gunnison. At most of these localities it is a smoothly
beveled surface, with highly contorted Precambrian rocks below
it and flat-lying Paleozoic sediments above it. Near Red Rocks
and La Veta Pass, the same relationship prevails, but the entire
contact, and the rocks above and below it, have been steeply
tilted by the uplift of the present mountains.</p>
<p>In portions of western North America, deposition late in
Precambrian time has left a series of flat-lying rocks between the
contorted Precambrian and later Paleozoic sediments. These rocks
can be seen in northwestern Colorado, where they form the dark
red sedimentary core of the Uinta Mountains.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<h3 id="c18">PALEOZOIC ERA</h3>
<p>Geologists have divided the second great era of geologic time
into units called Periods. The rocks deposited during a Period are
called Systems, but more often than not it is convenient to discuss
them in terms of easily recognized units of rock, called Formations.
Formations are named after areas in which they are well
exposed.</p>
<p>The <a href="#fig4">stratigraphic column</a> given in Chapter I shows the Periods
and Systems in their correct order, and gives the age in years for

<h3 id="c19">Cambrian Period
<br /><span class="small">(500-570 million years ago)</span></h3>
<p>The first fossiliferous rocks in Colorado were deposited during
the Cambrian Period, at a time when over much of the world
the seas were creeping in across wide, level plains formed during
the Lipalian Interval. Colorado was not covered by these seas
until quite late in the Cambrian Period. Beach deposits progressively
younger in age suggest that the sea invaded from the west,
and spread slowly eastward, inundating most of the central part
of the state but not the extreme north or south.</p>
<p>The beach deposits, now called the Sawatch Sandstone because
they are well exposed in the Sawatch Range, are composed mostly
of fine quartz sand. They are colored with glauconite, a green
mineral, and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Hematite">hematite</a>, a dark red mineral, so that the rock has
a variegated appearance. The post office at Manitou is built of this
red and green rock, and good exposures of it exist in Williams
Canyon near Manitou, along U. S. Highway 24 northwest of
Manitou, near Red Cliff and Minturn, and in Glenwood Canyon.</p>
<p>The sea which crept over Colorado at this time contained
small conical-shelled <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mollusk">mollusks</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Brachiopod">brachiopods</a>, and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Trilobite">trilobites</a>. Their
shells can occasionally be found in Cambrian rocks in Williams
Canyon and in the Sawatch and Mosquito Ranges. At two localities
unusual <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossils</a> called <a class="gloss" href="#g_Graptolite">graptolites</a> have been found in thin
Upper Cambrian shales overlying the Sawatch Sandstone.</p>

<h3 id="c20">Ordovician Period
<br /><span class="small">(440-500 million years ago)</span></h3>
<p>The sea deepened and widened as the Ordovician Period
began, and a series of limestones and dolomites was deposited,
either on top of the Sawatch Sandstone or, where the Sawatch
had not been deposited, directly on the Precambrian. These rocks
are now called the Manitou Formation.</p>
<p>The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossils</a> in these rocks are much more varied than those
in the Sawatch Sandstone: snails, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Echinoderm">echinoderms</a>, sponges, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cephalopod">cephalopods</a>,
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Brachiopod">brachiopods</a>, and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Trilobite">trilobites</a> are common. The Ordovician
sea must have teemed with life, as many rocks deposited at this
time are more than half composed of animal remains. In addition
to hard-shelled animals which formed fossils, there were probably
abundant soft-bodied animals such as jellyfish and worms, which
left no record of their presence.</p>
<p>After deposition of the Manitou Formation, the seas receded
slightly. A new series of sands was deposited above the Manitou
in central Colorado. These now form the Harding Sandstone,
a formation of unusual interest because it contains remains of the
earth&rsquo;s earliest known vertebrates, primitive jawless fish called
Agnathids. In places in the Harding Sandstone there are dense
accumulations of the tiny polygonal armor plates from these fish.
Although no whole fish have been found, we can reconstruct
their appearance by comparing individual plates or groups of
plates with later, better known relatives.</p>
<p>Also present in great quantities in the Harding Sandstone are
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Conodont">conodonts</a>, peculiar tiny brown tooth-like <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossils</a>. Relationships
of the conodonts are unknown; they may be parts of the Agnathids,
or perhaps they represent some entirely different group of animals,
with no living relatives.</p>
<p>After deposition of the sands of the Harding Sandstone, the
sea deepened locally and the Fremont Limestone, a massive gray
crystalline limestone containing many marine <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossils</a>, was deposited.
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Mollusk">Mollusks</a> (some quite large), <a class="gloss" href="#g_Brachiopod">brachiopods</a>, and corals contributed
their shells to the Fremont Limestone. The chain coral <i>Catenipora</i>
and the horn coral <i>Streptelasma</i> may often be used to identify the
formation.</p>
<p>The Fremont Limestone was deposited very late in the Ordovician
Period. Probably the seas were much more extensive then
than present deposits indicate; subsequent erosion has at several
times erased the evidence in uplifted areas.</p>

<h3 id="c21">Silurian Period
<br /><span class="small">(400-440 million years ago)</span></h3>
<p>Until very recently, no Silurian rocks or <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossils</a> were known
in Colorado, and it was thought that seas did not extend into the
state during this period. However, a few years ago good Silurian
corals and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Brachiopod">brachiopods</a> were discovered near the northern edge
of the state. They occur in broken blocks and patches of Silurian
limestone, mingled with blocks of other <a class="gloss" href="#g_SedimentaryRocks">sedimentary rocks</a> and,
oddly enough, with volcanic material.</p>
<p>What seems to have happened here is that sedimentary layers
of Silurian age <i>were</i> present over northern Colorado at one time.
During some subsequent period of volcanism, volcanic lavas
penetrated these sediments from below. Near the volcanic tubes,
broken, angular fragments of the surrounding sedimentary rocks
were sometimes carried upward or downward by the motion of
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Lava">lava</a>.</p>
<p>Much later, both the volcanic outpourings (if the lavas ever
reached the surface) and the sediments were stripped away by
erosion, probably at a time when mountains were rising in the
area. Only the deep portions of the tubes that fed the volcanoes
were preserved. These tubes are called <a class="gloss" href="#g_Diatreme">diatremes</a>, and thanks to
the blocks of sedimentary rock in them we know that there were
indeed seas in Colorado during Silurian time, seas containing the
abundant life of a shallow marine environment very much like that
existing at the same time in Illinois, Iowa, and Indiana.</p>
<h3 id="c22">Devonian Period
<br /><span class="small">(350-400 million years ago)</span></h3>
<p>As far as we know now, Colorado was just a little above sea
level during most of Devonian time. Early and Middle Devonian
deposits are lacking. Late in the period, however, Colorado was
widely inundated once more. Embayments of a western sea covered
most of the central part of the state and an area in southwestern
Colorado around Ouray.</p>
<p>Deposits formed in these embayments have been given several
names. Chaffee Formation is the name most commonly used in
central Colorado; Ouray Formation identifies rocks of the same
age in southwest Colorado. The Chaffee Formation has been
subdivided into two well defined units, the Parting Sandstone or
Quartzite, and the Dyer Dolomite or Limestone. Many ore deposits
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
are associated with these rock units&mdash;notably deposits of lead
and zinc. The Parting Sandstone is frequently so well cemented
with silica that it is actually a quartzite; thin shale beds or
&ldquo;partings&rdquo; make it easy to recognize. It frequently contains
remains of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> fish and distinctive beds of algae.</p>
<p>The Dyer Dolomite contains <a class="gloss" href="#g_Brachiopod">brachiopods</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Bryozoa">bryozoans</a>,
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Mollusk">mollusks</a> and corals. Some of the best <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> hunting in Colorado
is in Dyer beds around the White River <a class="gloss" href="#g_Plateau">Plateau</a>, where the fossils
frequently weather out of the rock as almost perfect specimens.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig27">

</div>
<h3 id="c23">Mississippian Period
<br /><span class="small">(310-350 million years ago)</span></h3>
<p>The sea continued to cover most of Colorado after the end of
the Devonian Period, well into Mississippian time. Mississippian
rocks are characteristically thick, massive gray limestones collectively
called the Leadville Limestone. This unit is well known
as the host rock for many Colorado ore deposits, notably those
around the town of Leadville.</p>
<p>During Mississippian time the western sea, warm and rich
in organisms, covered much of North America. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Brachiopod">Brachiopods</a> and
corals flourished, as did many other forms of life. The seas during
part of this time extended completely across Colorado to merge
with seas that covered the midwestern part of the United States.</p>
<p>Over all this vast area, as well as southwest into Arizona, the
gray, massive, fossiliferous Mississippian limestone is remarkably
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
uniform and easily recognized, although it is called by different
names in different areas.</p>
<p>Late in Mississippian time, the Colorado area rose slightly
and the sea in which the Leadville Limestone was deposited
receded. An interval of erosion followed. The surface of the limestone
was dissolved and pitted, tunnels and caves formed where
running water etched deep into the rock, and a reddish soil formed
on the surface and in the hollows. This portion of the limestone,
which in some places also contains pebbles of chert, is named the
Molas Formation. Part of the Molas may be Pennsylvanian in age.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="c24">Pennsylvanian Period
<br /><span class="small">(270-310 million years ago)</span></h3>
<p>As the Pennsylvanian Period began, the Colorado area continued
to rise. Earliest deposits of this age are fine-grained black
shales and sands&mdash;the Glen Eyrie Formation along the southern
Front Range and the Belden Formation in west central Colorado.
Then, through millions of years, mountain-building took place.
Some areas rose more than others, so that formerly flat-lying
marine sediments were bent and broken, and a series of high
mountain ridges and deep basins were formed. Geologists sometimes
call these the Ancestral Rocky Mountains.</p>
<p>Although the pattern of the mountains changed repeatedly,
the Ancestral Rockies consisted principally of two large ranges.
One range roughly paralleled the present Front Range, but lay
thirty to fifty miles further west. The other extended from the
San Luis Valley northwest toward Colorado National Monument,
including the area around the Black Canyon of the Gunnison and
the present Uncompahgre <a class="gloss" href="#g_Plateau">Plateau</a>. Coarse sediments washed off
both sides of both ranges, and accumulated as <a class="gloss" href="#g_AlluvialFan">alluvial fans</a> and
valley fill along the mountain margins. These exist today as the
Fountain Formation of the eastern Front Range, the Minturn
Formation between the ancient uplifts, and the Hermosa Formation
west of the western uplift.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>In the Flatirons near Boulder, Red Rocks Park near Denver,
and the Garden of the Gods near Colorado Springs we see well
exposed examples of the Fountain Formation. The Minturn
Formation is visible along the Eagle River west of Wolcott, and
along Gore Creek near Vail. The Hermosa Formation forms
striking red cliffs north of Durango. In the Sangre de Cristo
Mountains area, exceptionally great and rapid deposition took
place, and the Minturn Formation is very thick.</p>
<p>In west central Colorado, near the towns of Eagle and
Gypsum, a large basin formed. In it, gypsum and other salts were
deposited as arms of the sea were cut off from the main marine
area. The unusual appearance of the hills along the Eagle River,
especially north of U. S. Highway 24, is caused by the presence
of gypsum in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Bedrock">bedrock</a>.</p>
<p>In a similar manner, the Paradox Basin was formed in southwestern
Colorado. Thousands of feet of gypsum, salt, and potash
were deposited here, probably also precipitated in restricted arms
of the sea. These minerals, the so-called <a class="gloss" href="#g_Evaporite">evaporites</a>, have since
significantly controlled development of the landscape in Gypsum
Valley and other parts of this region. (See <a href="#c15">The Plateaus</a> in Chapter
I and the section on <a href="#c53">Gypsum</a> in Chapter III).</p>
<p>Between the mountain masses and their surrounding alluvial deposits, shallow seas repeatedly invaded the lowland areas of
the state. Marine <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossils</a> in some parts of the Minturn Formation
bear witness to as many as twenty marine cycles. Strangely, the
Pennsylvanian Period appears to have been cyclical in other parts
of the United States as well, for marine sediments are found
alternating with nonmarine sediments in Pennsylvania, Illinois,
Kansas, Nebraska, and New Mexico. In middle Pennsylvanian
time, general uplift occurred in Colorado, and almost the entire
state was above sea level for the rest of the period.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<h3 id="c25">Permian Period
<br /><span class="small">(223-270 million years ago)</span></h3>
<p>By the end of the Pennsylvanian Period, the mountains of the
Ancestral Rockies had been almost entirely removed by erosion,
and the deep basins were filled with sediments. Colorado was
once more a great plain, sloping gently to the northeast. In eastern
Colorado, a shallow sea gradually dried up, leaving some thin
limestone and gypsum beds along its margin. The western shore
of this sea was edged with beaches and sand dunes, preserved as
the Lyons Sandstone. The buildings of the University of Colorado,
as well as many homes and other structures in the Boulder-Denver
area, are faced with this beautiful salmon-colored sandstone.</p>

</div>
<p>In the western part of the state, Permian deposits consist
mostly of shales and sandstones. The red color of these rocks, and
the complete absence of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossils</a> in them, suggest that the environment
in which they were deposited was not marine, but was a vast,
level mudflat subject to alternating wet and dry periods. The
shales and sandstones collectively are called the Maroon Formation,
named for Maroon Bells, near Aspen, where they are
dramatically exposed in the mountain cliffs.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>During part of Permian time, a shallow sea extended from
Idaho, Utah, and Wyoming into the northwest corner of Colorado.
In this sea was deposited the Phosphoria Formation, a highly
phosphatic limestone containing only rare, poorly preserved
molluscan <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossils</a>.</p>
<p>As the Paleozoic Era ended, Colorado was still flat and low-lying.
By this time land plants and animals had evolved, but if
vegetation grew in the Colorado area, or animals roamed it, they
left few <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> remains. Tracks of early reptiles have been found
in the Lyons Sandstone. Dune sandstones here and in adjacent
areas suggest that desert conditions may have prevailed, in which
case Colorado would have been very similar, scenically and
climatically, to Sahara regions today.</p>

<h3 id="c26">MESOZOIC ERA</h3>
<p>The Mesozoic Era, popularly known as the Age of Reptiles
or Age of Dinosaurs, is divided into three periods. The climate
of the entire earth appears to have been warmer then than it is
at present, perhaps because of a different distribution of land
and sea areas, or because continental areas were not as high and
mountainous as they are just now. Colorado was a rather low
land area for most of the first two Mesozoic periods; then a vast
sea covered the entire state for the remainder of the era.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="c27">Triassic Period
<br /><span class="small">(180-225 million years ago)</span></h3>
<p>Saharan conditions continued to prevail in western North
America during the early part of the Mesozoic Era. In central
Colorado, the lowest Mesozoic deposits are the Triassic Lykins
Formation, a series of soft, bright red sandstones and shales.
Where the Lykins is exposed along the Front Range, its bright
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
red color identifies it. Because of its softness, it is often less
prominent than adjacent rock layers in the mountain foothills.
The Lykins Formation includes some <a class="gloss" href="#g_Evaporite">evaporites</a>, apparently
derived from Permian evaporites washed into the Triassic ponds
and lakes which existed occasionally in this region.</p>
<p>Over almost the entire state, the rocks deposited at this time
are very similar. Formation names may differ&mdash;Lykins, Moenkopi,
Chinle, Ankareh, Wingate&mdash;but the rocks are almost
universally fine-grained sandstones and shales with a red or pink
color. They represent ancient coastal plain, dune, or delta deposits.
Toward the western edge of the state they coarsen, and contain
layers of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Conglomerate">conglomerates</a> similar to the Triassic conglomerates of
northern Arizona and Utah. These suggest that mountain-building
was taking place west of here at that time.</p>
<p>There are virtually no <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossils</a> known from Triassic rocks in
Colorado, although some fossil palm fronds have been found west
of the San Juan Mountains, in the southwestern corner of the state.</p>
<h3 id="c28">Jurassic Period
<br /><span class="small">(135-180 million years ago)</span></h3>
<p>During the Jurassic Period, Colorado was still a low, flat desert
area with intermittent streams flowing eastward over the surface
of older sediments. The Navajo Sandstone, formed from dune
sands, was deposited in the western part of the state. Streams flowing
eastward from Utah brought fine sediments&mdash;silts and muds&mdash;to
western Colorado, forming what is now the Carmel Formation.
Near Canon City, coarse gravels bear witness to local uplift
in Jurassic time. Both these gravels and the Carmel Formation
were overlain by more dune sands, now hardened into the Entrada
Sandstone.</p>
<p>In Late Jurassic time the Colorado area, which had been
predominantly desert since Permian time, appears finally to have
been submerged once more. Fine calcareous muds of the Curtis
Formation, containing <a class="gloss" href="#g_Ammonite">ammonites</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Belemnite">belemnites</a>, and other marine
shellfish, show us that a shallow sea transgressed from the west
over the wind-blown sands. This sea was, geologically speaking,
of short duration&mdash;only a few million years. Bounded on almost
all sides by desert, it seems to have dried up, depositing the gypsum
that is now present in a thin layer along the Front Range between
Denver and Canon City in the Ralston Formation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>At about this time, however, the climate underwent a major
change. Deposits above the Ralston indicate an increasingly moist
environment, the environment in which the Morrison Formation
was deposited over most of Colorado and parts of the adjacent
states of Kansas, Arizona, Utah, and Wyoming. The Morrison
Formation is exposed in many places, and is characteristically
composed of layers of fine, limy mud, brightly colored in streaks
of red, brown, green, and blue. In most areas it is so soft that it
becomes soil-covered; it is well exposed only in roadcuts or where
it is protected from erosion by a &ldquo;caprock&rdquo; of harder sediments
or <a class="gloss" href="#g_Lava">lava</a>. Spectacular outcrops can be seen in new roadcuts along
U. S. Interstate highway 70 just west of Denver.</p>

<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">Fossil</a> dinosaur bones occur in great numbers in the Morrison
Formation near the towns of Morrison and Canon City and at
several other places in Colorado. Those at Canon City have been
quarried extensively, and are now mounted in a number of
museums in the United States. At Dinosaur National Monument, in
eastern Utah and northwestern Colorado, many excellent remains
have been found; those in Utah can be seen in place in the rock
in a striking exhibit at the National Monument.</p>

<p>Some of the dinosaurs known from the Morrison Formation
reached 80 feet in length. Both plant-eating and meat-eating types
are known. In addition to the bones themselves, gastroliths or
gizzard stones can frequently be found; these highly polished
stones were as essential to dinosaur digestion as gravel is to a
chicken or a caged canary.</p>
<p>Along with the dinosaur <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossils</a> are found abundant remains
of water plants called charophytes. These plants formed tiny
spiralled balls of calcite as part of their reproductive activities;
both the little balls and the stalks of the plants themselves occur
in many parts of the state. In western Colorado, near Grand
Junction, silicified shells of freshwater snails can also be found
in the Morrison.</p>
<p>Early in the 1900s vanadium, radium, and uranium were
discovered in Jurassic sandstones and mudstones of western Colorado.
Extensive mining in this area has revealed that these
elements often become concentrated by groundwater in organic
material such as <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> plant stems or dinosaur bones. The search
for radioactive minerals has thus brought to light many ancient
fossil accumulations.</p>

<h3 id="c29">Cretaceous Period

rock types from beach and near-shore deposits to true marine
sediments.</p>

<p>The sandstones derived from beach sands sometimes include
coarse pebbles of chert which can be traced to sources in Permian
rocks of Utah and Nevada. Occasionally the beach and near-shore
deposits include marine shells like oysters, indicating that
there were brackish and salt water lagoons and marshes along the
shore. The Dakota Formation represents the beach of the transgressive
or advancing sea. This formation contains oil in eastern
Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyoming; the oil itself may have been
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
derived from decay of organic materials in swamps behind the
beaches and bars.</p>
<p>As the sea deepened in eastern Colorado, finer sediments were
deposited. These included the black muds of the Benton Shale,
and the Niobrara Limestone, a shallow-water deposit containing
abundant shells of clams (<i>Inoceramus</i> and <i>Ostrea</i>) and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Ammonite">ammonites</a>
and tiny one-celled animals called <a class="gloss" href="#g_Foraminiferida">Foraminiferida</a>. Above the
Benton and Niobrara Formations lie the fine gray muds of the
Pierre Shale. Several thousand feet thick, the Pierre contains
occasional beautifully preserved ammonite shells as well as bones
from <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> fish and swimming reptiles.</p>

<p>The rocks deposited in western Colorado at this time are
markedly different from those deposited in eastern Colorado. In
the east, deposits are fine and very limy, containing abundant
shells and little in the way of coarse debris. In the west, sandstones
of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesa">Mesa</a> Verde Formation dominate, and coal beds suggest
marshy or swampy conditions inshore from the ancient ocean.
This is just the pattern we would expect from a low-lying region
bordering a shallow sea, a region similar perhaps to the southeastern
Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States today.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the Cretaceous Period, the sea receded
from Colorado. Beaches and bars of the retreating sea left a
sandstone layer which now outcrops prominently east of the Front
Range as the Fox Hills Sandstone. Above lie interbedded sands
and coals, the Laramie Formation. The presence of coal above
beach sands shows that the coal swamps moved eastward as the
sea retreated.</p>
<p>The exact age of the shoreline deposits and coal beds varies
from place to place in such a way as to indicate that the sea
withdrew slowly and irregularly. In general the shore moved
eastward, but there are localities such as North Park where deposition
lasted much longer than elsewhere. In some places no real
beach was formed at the ancient strand line.</p>
<p>In western Colorado, the end of Cretaceous time is marked by
coarser beds, indicating an increased rate of uplift in Utah. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Conglomerate">Conglomerates</a>
were deposited in the beds of the McDermott
Formation, now visible along the Animas River south of Durango.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<h3 id="c30">CENOZOIC ERA</h3>
<p>It is characteristic of earth history that the younger the rocks
are, the more we know about them. This is because younger rocks
lie near the surface, have not been disturbed as much by mountain
building processes as have older rocks, and have not been affected
as strongly by repeated erosion. Many of the events of the Cenozoic
Era are documented in detail in the geology of Colorado, and these
events have intimately influenced the scenery as we see it today.</p>
<p>The Cenozoic is the Age of Mammals. How it happened that
mammals triumphed over reptiles is one of the mysteries of
geology. Some scientists think that climatic changes&mdash;dropping
temperatures and increases in rainfall&mdash;swung the balance in
favor of the warm-blooded mammals. Others believe that cosmic
ray bombardment during some unusual astronomical event may
have destroyed many surface-living dinosaurs, while small burrowing
mammals (as well as many small reptiles) were able to survive.
Still others maintain that the superior intelligence and regulated
body temperatures of mammals enabled them to win out in the
battle for survival without the aid of climatic or cosmic change.</p>
<p>The names Tertiary and Quaternary, used for the two Cenozoic
Periods, are holdovers from early studies in geology in which
rocks were divided into Primary (very hard, crystalline rocks such
as igneous and metamorphic rocks), Secondary (well consolidated
layered rocks), Tertiary (layered rocks which are not fully
cemented but which are nevertheless fairly well consolidated),
and Quaternary (sediments in which the grains have not become
cemented together).</p>
<h3 id="c31">Tertiary Period
<br /><span class="small">(3-70 million years ago)</span></h3>
<p>During the first part of the Tertiary Period, uplift began in
earnest in Colorado and adjacent states. This uplift was part of
the great Laramide Orogeny that built the Rocky Mountain chain
from Alaska to New Mexico. The entire area rose above the level
of the sea, and mountains were thrust up in a great series of north-south
ranges that extended unbroken almost the length of the
continent. Between the ranges, thick layers of gravel and sand,
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
derived from the surrounding highlands, were deposited in intermontane
basins. Occasional freshwater limestones and shales
indicate the presence of lakes.</p>
<p>In Colorado, many details of the formation of the Rockies
stand out in bold relief. The Front Range moved upward sharply,
mostly as a linear block broken or faulted along both edges.
Paleozoic and Mesozoic sediments along the margins of the block
were steeply tipped and in some places even overturned, while
in some localities Precambrian rocks were thrust out over the
younger sediments.</p>
<p>Just east of the Front Range, especially in the area around
Denver, the land remained lower and was the site of thick deposits
of gravel and sand eroded from the range. The Denver Formation,
the Arapahoe <a class="gloss" href="#g_Conglomerate">Conglomerate</a>, and the Dawson Arkose are more
than 2,000 feet thick in this area. These are delta and river
sediments, all varying a great deal from place to place. Individual
layers of sand or gravel are not continuous over extensive areas,
but some, such as the Castle Rock Conglomerate, are very prominent
locally.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig41">

<a class="gloss" href="#g_Fault">fault</a> shows clearly because trees prefer the granite soil above the
fault to the shale below. (Jack Rathbone photo)</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>Along the eastern margin of the Front Range west of Castle
Rock and Sedalia, rocks deposited at this time are now folded
steeply, indicating that the mountains continued to rise even as
basin sediments were being deposited.</p>
<p>In southern Colorado, the Sangre de Cristo and Wet Mountains
were also formed as upthrust blocks. Between them, the Huerfano
Basin and adjoining Raton Basin received particularly rapid
alluvial deposition. In the Raton Basin, quantities of vegetation
were deposited in swamps and marshes, forming the thick coal
beds which can now be seen in road cuts west of Trinidad and
along the Raton Pass highway. Huerfano Basin deposits contain
some of the earliest known horse remains, skeletons of a tiny
four-toed horse called <i>Hyracotherium</i> (formerly known as
<i>Eohippus</i>).</p>

</div>
<p>Other rising ranges provided material for alluvial deposition
in North Park, Middle Park, South Park, and the San Luis Valley.
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
Layers of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Basalt">basalt</a> and volcanic peaks show that as the mountains
rose, the crust cracked and allowed <a class="gloss" href="#g_Lava">lava</a> to rise to the surface
in great quantities. Tertiary basalts are very much part of the
Colorado landscape: some can be seen west of Granby, others
in Table Mountains east of Golden. Near Boulder, Valmont <a class="gloss" href="#g_Dike">Dike</a>
was intruded, though lava may not have reached the surface in
that area. Spanish Peaks in southern Colorado, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesa">Mesa</a> de Maya,
the Rabbit Ears Range, Grand and Battlement Mesas, and many
other volcanic features were formed at this time.</p>

<p>Most of the rich mineral deposits of Colorado are thought
also to have been formed during the early part of the Tertiary
Period. Solutions rich in gold, silver, zinc, lead, copper, and
sulfides of iron seeped into <a class="gloss" href="#g_Joint">joints</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fault">faults</a> in the crust as the
mountains were pushed upward. Ore minerals crystallized out,
sometimes in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Vein">veins</a> in the ancient Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rocks, sometimes in Paleozoic sediments. These are
further discussed in <a href="#c33">Chapter III</a>.</p>

burn with a yellow, smoky flame. (Jack Rathbone photo)</p>
</div>
<p>Further to the north and west, the Uinta Mountains rose.
They are a fault-block range, but they lie at right angles to the
general north-south trend of the Rocky Mountains. South of them
the Uinta Basin, one of the largest of the intermontane basins,
received shaly deposits in a great lake which existed here for
probably several million years. The lake extended over some
100,000 square miles, and during its existence great quantities
of tiny organisms lived in its waters. Oily material from these
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
organisms was deposited in the mud of the lake sediments, particularly
in the eastern end of the basin, there to remain trapped in
a great oil-shale deposit. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">Fossil</a> fish, crayfish, algae, and many
forms of insect and plant life have been found as fossils in these
lake shales.</p>
<p>West of Pikes Peak, another lake formed, dammed by a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Lava">lava</a>
flow from a nearby volcanic field. Fine volcanic ash falling into
this lake preserved the trunks and leaves of many plants as well
as abundant insects, fish, and occasional mammal bones. These
are now protected and exhibited in Florissant <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">Fossil</a> Beds National
Monument. The fossil plants, among them redwoods, poplar,
hackberry, and pine, suggest a climate warmer than the present
one, and have been taken to indicate that regional uplift to the
present altitude had not yet occurred.</p>
<p>Another rich deposit of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> insects and plants occurs near
Creede. Other lake deposits in South Park contain ash layers
with fossil algae and snails.</p>

</div>
<p>In southwestern Colorado, extensive Tertiary <a class="gloss" href="#g_Lava">lava</a> flows, ash
falls, and river deposits form the eastern part of the San Juan
Mountains, the largest volcanic area in the state. Mineral collectors
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
are attracted to this region by the many excellent localities for
agate and other siliceous stones.</p>
<p>Still another center of Tertiary volcanism was located in what
is now Rocky Mountain National Park. Specimen Mountain,
northwest of Trail Ridge, was an active volcano about 30 million
years ago, shedding ash and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Lava">lava</a> over much of northern Colorado.
The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rhyolite">rhyolite</a> which now caps the hill west of Iceberg Lake, on
Trail Ridge Road, was derived from this volcano, but is now
separated from it by the deep glaciated valley of the Cache la
Poudre River and Milner Pass.</p>
<p>Volcanic ash at times drifted far eastward and blanketed the
surface of the plains, burying specimens of many animals and
plants. The White River Formation, extending from northeast
Colorado northward into South Dakota, is formed of such drifting
ash. Many now-extinct mammals have been excavated from this
formation.</p>
<p>Sometime after the mid-Tertiary episode of violent volcanic
activity, Colorado was uplifted to its present altitude. This was a
general uplift, raising the plains and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Plateau">plateau</a> areas as well as the
mountains. The uplift was not an abrupt process, but continued
for perhaps ten million years. It raised the entire state 3,000 to
5,000 feet above its previous level.</p>

</div>
<p>During the remainder of the Tertiary Period, Colorado was
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
the site of erosion rather than deposition. However, some stream
material was deposited in the mountain valleys, and on the
prairies wind-blown and stream-borne sands were spread thinly,
interlayered with impure limestones deposited in ponds and lakes.
In the San Luis Valley, deposition was probably more continuous
than elsewhere, as the exit from the valley was blocked by volcanic
flows. The deposits in this valley, sands and clays of the Santa Fe
and Alamosa Formations, form a great artesian basin. The rich
agricultural development of the valley is made possible by water
wells tapping these formations.</p>

<h3 id="c32">Quaternary Period
<br /><span class="small">(3 million years ago to present)</span></h3>
<p>The most significant feature of the Quaternary Period in
Colorado, as elsewhere in the northern hemisphere, is the evidence
of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Glaciation">glaciation</a>. During the first part of the Quaternary Period,
known as the Pleistocene Epoch, great continental <a class="gloss" href="#g_Glacier">glaciers</a> covered
most of Canada and much of northern United States. The ice
sheets did not extend southward as far as Colorado, but large
valley glaciers developed in many of the mountain ranges of the
state and left their traces in many mountain valleys.</p>

<a class="gloss" href="#g_Gneiss">gneiss</a>, and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Schist">schist</a> at the Front Range &ldquo;core.&rdquo; (Jack Rathbone photo)</p>
</div>
<p>The conditions leading to Pleistocene <a class="gloss" href="#g_Glaciation">glaciation</a> are not fully
understood. Climatic changes may have been initiated by a
decrease in solar radiation, changing patterns of ocean currents,
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
reduction of solar heating by volcanic dust, or an increase in
general elevation of the land. As the climate became cooler and
moister, snowfall increased in the north and at high altitudes.
In areas where winter snowfall exceeded summer melting, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Glacier">glaciers</a>
developed.</p>
<p>In Colorado, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Glacier">glaciers</a> formed along the crests of the Front
Range, the Sawatch Range, the Elk Mountains and West Elk
Mountains, the Sangre de Cristo and Mosquito Ranges, the San
Juan Mountains, and the Park and Gore Ranges. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Glaciation">Glaciation</a> in
Colorado was selective: in many places elevation was sufficient
for glaciation, but snowfall apparently was not great enough.
Where they did occur, the glaciers extended down to elevations
of about 8,000 feet. There, temperatures became mild enough to
melt the ice.</p>
<p>The mountain <a class="gloss" href="#g_Glacier">glaciers</a> have left many tell-tale signs of their
presence. Valleys above 8,000 feet are U-shaped, their upper ends
bounded by horseshoe-shaped, steep-walled <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cirque">cirques</a>. In the lower
portions of the valleys, at elevations just above 8,000 feet, lie long
lines of glacial debris known as <a class="gloss" href="#g_Moraine">moraines</a>: terminal moraines
forming crescents across the valleys to show where melting glaciers
dropped their rocky loads; lateral moraines along the sides of
valleys; medial moraines where glaciers from two valleys met.
Terminal moraines, often forming effective barriers across the
present streams, may act as dams, creating lakes such as Grand
Lake in Rocky Mountain National Park.</p>
<p>There were at least three distinct glacial episodes in Colorado.
This is known because careful studies of glacial debris in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Moraine">moraines</a>
reveal three different degrees of rock weathering. All three stages
can be seen in or near Rocky Mountain National Park. The oldest
is represented by a moraine about three miles west of Estes Park,
where the Big Thompson River traverses a wide U-shaped valley
before entering its narrow, unglaciated canyon. The next oldest
is represented in terminal moraines further up the valley, at Aspenglen
campground. The youngest is shown in a prominent terminal
moraine about one mile west of the park entrance in Horseshoe
Park.</p>
<p>A large lateral <a class="gloss" href="#g_Moraine">moraine</a> separates Hidden Valley from the south
side of Horseshoe Park, and an almost equally large lateral moraine
is present on the north side of this valley. At Moraine Park, both
sides of the valley are edged with lateral moraines also.</p>
<p>Studies in Rocky Mountain National Park have revealed many
other details of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Glaciation">glaciation</a> in this area. These are described in Park
Service brochures and guidebooks, in the museum at Park headquarters,
and in informative roadside signs.</p>

the snowfield in the dirty gray glacial ice. (H. H. Heuston photo)</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>Several small <a class="gloss" href="#g_Glacier">glaciers</a> are still present in the Colorado mountains,
all in sheltered <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cirque">cirques</a> above 11,000 feet. These may be
remnants of the former larger glaciers, or new glaciers formed
after a long warming episode. A hike to one of these glaciers is
a rewarding experience for anyone interested in geology. Some of
the more accessible are St. Mary&rsquo;s Glacier west of Denver,
Arapaho Glacier west of Boulder (the Boulder Chamber of
Commerce sponsors a festive hike to Arapaho Glacier every
August), and Tyndall Glacier in Rocky Mountain National Park.</p>
<p>The Ice Age brought drastic changes also to the landscape
below 8,000 feet elevation. Heavily loaded with glacial debris,
mountain streams disgorged coarse sands and gravels along the
mountain front and in the intermontane basins. As the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Glacier">glaciers</a>
melted after each period of expansion, the swollen streams cut
deeply into their former deposits and into much older rocks as
well. Royal Gorge, the Black Canyon of the Gunnison, and many
of the deep, colorful canyons of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Plateau">Plateau</a> Province were cut or
at least deepened by these waters. The canyons along the east
face of the mountains&mdash;Big Thompson, Boulder, Clear Creek, and
others&mdash;were also deepened and sharpened by the rushing ice-fed
torrents.</p>
<p>On the prairies, rivers dumping their loads of sand covered
the older rocks. Sand dunes developed along the river channels.
Bones and huge tusks of hairy mammoths were sometimes buried
in these soft deposits; now they are occasionally revealed as the
dune and river sands are washed or blown away by continuing
erosion.</p>
<p>About 20,000 years ago, man arrived in Colorado. Soon after
this, the water supply of the valleys diminished greatly, and erosion
slowed down correspondingly. The climate gradually became
semiarid to arid. Many features of the natural scene were much
as they must have been a century ago, without the highways, dams,
and television aerials of today. Buffalo and many smaller types
of game roamed the plains and foothills; deer, elk, and bighorn
sheep were plentiful in the mountains. Nomadic tribes camped
and hunted in both mountain and prairie. In the western part of
the state, homes could be built in the shelter of great caves, as at
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesa">Mesa</a> Verde, and game could be supplemented with corn and
squash planted on <a class="gloss" href="#g_Plateau">plateau</a> surfaces.</p>
<p>Several features of Colorado scenery changed with increasing
aridity. The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Glacier">glaciers</a> of course were gone or nearly gone. Streams
were no longer the violent torrents they had been. Many mountain
lakes, filled with sediment and vegetation, became instead mountain
meadows. And the once fertile intermontane valleys became
deserts.</p>

<p>On the eastern side of the San Luis Valley, the Great Sand
Dunes developed at this time. These dunes nestle against the
Sangre de Cristo Range, where strong southwesterly winds blowing
across the wide valley tend to funnel toward Mosca and Music
Passes. These winds lift loads of sand from the lightly vegetated
valley floor, and drop it as they rise over the mountains. Where
the sand is dropped, the dunes have formed. They rise to about
700 feet above the valley floor, and cover about forty square miles.
The low rainfall of the area, seven to eight inches per year, keeps
vegetation from creeping over the dunes and makes them a most
distinctive feature of Colorado, a lesson in geology in the making.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Geologic processes in Colorado now seem to be much
reduced from what they were a few thousand years ago. Reduction
in rainfall has led to reduced erosion. Mountain-building, having
reached a climax in Tertiary time, has declined markedly. However,
we find evidence that volcanism has occurred within the last
few thousand years and faulting within the last few hundred, and
Colorado streams rise after sudden mountain storms to approximate
the violent torrents of glacial times. Colorado&rsquo;s scenery,
fashioned during some three billion years of earth history, is ever
changing.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">Geology and Man in Colorado</span></h2>
<p>Colorado&rsquo;s first permanent settlers arrived in 1858, when
gold was discovered in river sands near what is now the
city of Denver. The ensuing gold rush, coming ten years after
the rush to California, rivalled it in fury and brought sudden
wealth to lucky miners and the adventurous merchants who grubstaked
them. Several hundred mining towns or &ldquo;camps&rdquo; sprang
into existence almost overnight, their sites determined by the
geology of the mountain areas. The cities of Denver, Boulder, and
Golden were established as milling and shipping centers for the
products of the mines. In 1876 the now-wealthy area, previously
part of Kansas Territory, became the State of Colorado.</p>
<p>For more than a hundred years Colorado&rsquo;s minerals&mdash;products
of her long and diverse geologic history&mdash;have influenced
her development in many ways. The state&rsquo;s early wealth,
stemming from bonanzas in gold and silver, is evidenced by
palatial homes, hotels, and public buildings constructed during
the first few decades of mining activity. Some of these are still
standing&mdash;the opera houses at Central City and Aspen, Central
City&rsquo;s famous Teller House, and the Grand Imperial Hotel at
Silverton are examples.</p>
<p>Many of the stories and legends of Colorado&rsquo;s gold camps are
recounted in <i>Stampede to Timberline</i>, by Muriel Sibell Wolle,
delightfully illustrated with sketches of old mining towns as they
appear today. <i>Mining in Colorado</i>, published by the U. S. Geological
Survey, also makes fascinating reading, as it contains many
historical anecdotes and eyewitness accounts of gold-rush days.</p>
<p>Development of the metal-mining areas in Colorado followed
a definite sequence. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Placer">Placer</a> gold was usually discovered first.
Recovery of placer gold was followed by mining of gold from
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Vein">veins</a> or &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Lode">lodes</a>.&rdquo; Although at first only <a class="gloss" href="#g_NativeGold">native gold</a> was mined,
gold-bearing compounds such as telluride were soon recognized
as an additional source, especially at Gold Hill, Cripple Creek,
and of course the camp that came to be known as Telluride.
As gold sources were depleted, silver, first produced as a byproduct,
became of prime interest. Lead and zinc were in turn
byproducts of silver mining. Other metals, notably copper,
vanadium, tungsten, and iron, were produced later. Molybdenum

now the chief metal produced. A uranium boom in the 1950s
brought a short rush to western Colorado and new vigor to the
economy.</p>
<p>Oil was discovered near Canon City in 1862. The nearby
Florence field and a small, shallow field near Boulder preceded
much greater discoveries in the Denver Basin, the Uinta Basin,
and southwest Colorado. Oil reservoirs, confined to areas of
sedimentary rock, are found primarily in the Prairie and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Plateau">Plateau</a>
Provinces of the state, and recovery of the oil has done much to
distribute population to these areas.</p>
<p>Coal is also restricted to sedimentary rock areas. Coal production
in Colorado has waxed and waned with the years, but has
provided fuel for export, for the railroads, for the manufacture
of electric power, and for many of the state&rsquo;s industries.</p>

<p>Colorado is now the nation&rsquo;s leading producer of molybdenum,
tin, and vanadium, and second in output of tungsten. In oil
production it ranked twelfth among the states in 1968, but ninth
in reserves, with 420,000,000 barrels of proven reserves on
1 January 1969. An as yet untapped source of oil lies in the oil
shales of western Colorado.</p>
<p>As part of the natural environment, water plays a major role
in man&rsquo;s activities. Water problems in Colorado revolve mainly
around the best use of runoff in a state whose major catchment
basins are across the continental divide from her largest population
centers and most fertile farm land. Groundwater, closely
related to surface water distribution and movement, is a geological
problem, and in Colorado as in other states many government
and private geologists serve farm and industrial communities in
the search for usable supplies.</p>

<h3 id="c34">GOLD, SILVER, AND OTHER METALS</h3>
<p>Colorado&rsquo;s <a class="gloss" href="#g_Placer">placer</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Lode">lode</a> sources of gold, which gave first
impetus to the series of mining booms in the state, were fantastically
rich. Summit and Lake Counties, for instance, each
produced more than $5,000,000 in placer gold between 1859 and
1867. During the same nine-year period, more than $9,000,000
in lode gold was produced from Gregory Gulch, a tiny canyon
between Central City and Black Hawk. Other districts rivalled
or surpassed these figures.</p>
<p>Early in the game it was recognized that almost all the deposits
occurred along what came to be known as the &ldquo;mineral belt,&rdquo; a
fifty-mile-wide zone extending southwest from the Boulder region.
Most of the metals mined in the state come from this belt, but
there are three notable exceptions: Cripple Creek, Silver Cliff, and
western Colorado vanadium and uranium districts. In the first
few years of the Colorado rush, gold ores and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Placer">placer</a> gold were
discovered only in the northeastern part of the mineral belt.
Gradually the belt was found to extend further and further southwest:
Tincup was discovered in 1861, Silverton in 1870, Lake
City in 1871, and Telluride in 1875. Aspen, on the western edge
of the belt, was not discovered until 1879, perhaps because the
area was difficult of access and lacked the easily recognizable
<a class="gloss" href="#g_NativeGold">native gold</a>.</p>
<p>In the northeast part of the mineral belt, gold and other
minerals occur in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Vein">veins</a> in Precambrian <a class="gloss" href="#g_Granite">granite</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Gneiss">gneiss</a>. In the
Leadville and Aspen areas, ores are associated with altered
Paleozoic limestones. At the southwest end of the mineral belt,
in the San Juan Mountains, ore veins are found near or in Tertiary
volcanic rocks. <a class="gloss" href="#g_NativeGold">Native gold</a>, gold-bearing compounds, and other
metallic ores in these veins originated where mineral-rich solutions
from deep within the earth penetrated fissures and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Joint">joints</a> in the
surrounding rock. Regardless of the age of the host rock, almost
all the ores of Colorado were deposited in the early or middle
Tertiary Period, about 35 to 70 million years ago.</p>
<p>Gold and silver are no longer mined extensively in Colorado,
although any summer Sunday will see weekend operators panning
near mountain streams or trundling rock from one-man mines.
The recent rise in the price of silver has encouraged many miners
to reopen old shafts. The most active mines in the state today
are those producing molybdenum, lead, zinc, and vanadium.
(Vanadium, although a metal, usually occurs in Colorado with
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
radioactive minerals, and so is discussed with them rather than
with the metals.)</p>
<div class="img" id="fig53">

<p class="caption">The Colorado mineral belt extends from Boulder County on the northeast
to San Juan County on the southwest. Almost all of the prominent
mining districts in Colorado lie along this belt. Cripple Creek
and Silver Cliff, however, lie far to the east of the general trend.</p>

<p>All told, some 430 metal mining districts have been established
as legal entities in the state of Colorado. Each of these districts
had the right to draw up its own regulations concerning prospecting,
claims, and mining rights, within a framework established by
the Federal government. Only a few of the districts ever became
really significant producers. The geology and history of several
of the leading areas are presented in the pages that follow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<h3 id="c35">Boulder County</h3>
<p>Gold Run, near Gold Hill, was the scene of one of the earliest
strikes in Colorado. Gold was found here in December 1858, and
was sluiced from stream sands and mined from <a class="gloss" href="#g_Vein">veins</a> early in 1859.
Active <a class="gloss" href="#g_Placer">placer</a> mining lasted only about a year, however, and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Lode">lode</a>
mining dropped off rapidly as near-surface oxidized ores were
worked out. When a smelter was erected at Black Hawk in 1868,
and sulfide ores could be treated, there was a revival of activity.
In 1869 the Caribou and Poorman mines near Nederland were
discovered; they quickly became the most active mines in the
county. The Ward district opened soon after.</p>
<p>In 1872, a gold-silver telluride called <a class="gloss" href="#g_Petzite">petzite</a> was found in
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Vein">veins</a> at Gold Hill. Renewed prospecting in this area resulted in
location of mines near Sunshine, Salina, and Magnolia. During
the years that followed, new mines appeared almost as fast as old
ones were depleted. In 1892, the peak year, more than $1,000,000
in gold and silver was produced; total production has been about
$25,000,000.</p>
<p>In 1900, a black mineral common in the Nederland area was
recognized as ferberite, an ore of tungsten, and a new rush to the
area started. During the next eighteen years Boulder County was
the main tungsten producer in the United States; about 24,000
tons of tungsten trioxide, worth $23,000,000, were produced
here. The ore was found in nearly vertical <a class="gloss" href="#g_Vein">veins</a> six inches to
three feet thick, in a lenticular area about nine miles long extending
from Nederland northeast to Arkansas Mountain, four miles
west of Boulder.</p>
<p>Boulder County is characterized by an abundance of small
mines. Old shafts, pits, and mine buildings can be found throughout
the central part of the county. Little mining is done here
today; many of the towns that once peppered these hills have
fallen into decay or disappeared entirely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<h3 id="c36">Central City and Idaho Springs</h3>
<p>The Central City-Idaho Springs area was the principal metal
mining region in the state until the late 1880s. In 1858, rich
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Placer">placer</a> deposits were discovered in gravels and river terraces along
both forks of Clear Creek. Exploration upstream led to discoveries
of rich oxidized quartz <a class="gloss" href="#g_Vein">veins</a> at Central City, Black Hawk, and
Idaho Springs. These veins, which generally trend northeast-southwest,
extend through the mountains in a zone about six
miles long and three miles wide between the two forks of Clear
Creek.</p>
<p>The ores filled a multitude of cracks and fissures in the
Precambrian <a class="gloss" href="#g_Bedrock">bedrock</a>. The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Vein">veins</a> are usually less than five feet
thick, and are almost vertical and often clustered in zones up to
thirty feet wide. The position of one of the vein systems may be
seen clearly between Black Hawk and Central City&mdash;the ore-bearing
rock has been mined out, but a series of collapsed tunnels
marks the line where the veins crossed the valley. A monument
here commemorates the discovery of Gregory Gulch, one of the
richest localities in the state.</p>
<p>Several rich <a class="gloss" href="#g_Vein">veins</a> were mined in both directions&mdash;southwest
from Central City and northeast from Idaho Springs&mdash;until the
mines met. The Argo tunnel, marked by dilapidated buildings and
extensive dumps on the north side of Idaho Springs, connected
the two districts; it was completed in 1904.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Patch,&rdquo; a deep crater-like hole on Quartz Hill, about
one mile southwest of Central City, is an intriguing feature in this
area. It was produced by glory-holing, a mining technique in which
a deep tunnel is deliberately caved by blasting, so that ores above
the tunnel can be removed. This glory hole was dynamited below
an irregular mass of highly broken rock where many ore-rich <a class="gloss" href="#g_Vein">veins</a>
converged. After the caving, ores were taken out through the
remaining part of the tunnel.</p>
<p>The principal ore minerals of Central City and Idaho Springs
are <a class="gloss" href="#g_NativeGold">native gold</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pyrite">pyrite</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sphalerite">sphalerite</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Galena">galena</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Chalcopyrite">chalcopyrite</a>, and
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Tennantite">tennantite</a>. Prospecting for uranium was carried out during the
1950s but no uranium was ever mined here.</p>
<p>The area has produced almost $200,000,000 worth of gold,
silver, lead, zinc, and copper. A few mines still operate seasonally
or on a small scale, but tourists, many of them riding Jeeps across
the mountainous terrain to visit mines and ghost towns, are often
more visibly active than the mines.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<h3 id="c37">Georgetown, Empire, and Silver Plume</h3>
<p>A few miles southwest of Idaho Springs, another mining area
had a similar, though less productive, history. In 1859, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Placer">placer</a> and
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Lode">lode</a> gold were discovered near what is now Georgetown. Placer
mining dominated here between 1859 and 1863. Gravel and
crushed rock from decomposed quartz and sulfide <a class="gloss" href="#g_Vein">veins</a> were
washed through sluiceboxes in the same way as placer gravel,
gold being caught in riffles or gunny sacking on the bottoms of
the troughs. The veins were found to be decomposed to depths
of about 40 feet; below this the gold occurred closely associated
with sulfides such as <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pyrite">pyrite</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sphalerite">sphalerite</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Galena">galena</a>, and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Chalcopyrite">chalcopyrite</a>,
from which it could not easily be separated. However, smelters
were developed in 1866 for treatment of these sulfides, and gold,
silver, lead, and copper were recovered. Gradually, as the gold
was worked out, silver and lead became the important products
of the mines.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig54">

<p class="caption">Sluicebox mining was a common sight near the early gold camps,
where primary recovery was from <a class="gloss" href="#g_Placer">placer</a> deposits or decomposed
quartz and sulfide <a class="gloss" href="#g_Vein">veins</a>. (State Historical Society of Colorado photo)</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<h3 id="c38">Leadville</h3>
<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_Placer">Placer</a> gold was discovered in 1859 in California Gulch, about
seven miles north of the present town of Leadville. The rush that
followed was short but sweet; the camp was called Oro&mdash;gold!
About $5,000,000 was produced from the placer mines within
two years, though by 1861 the area was all but deserted, for the
easily won placer gold was gone.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig55">
<img src="images/p40.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="648" />
<p class="caption">Early-day Leadville sprawled among its mine dumps at an elevation

many smaller mining communities, now deserted. Mt. Massive, the
state&rsquo;s second highest peak, forms the crest of the continental divide
here. (State Historical Society of Colorado photo)</p>
</div>
<p>In 1875 a smelter was erected a few miles downstream from
Oro to process cerussite&mdash;silver-rich lead carbonate&mdash;that
occurred in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Placer">placer</a> sands. For years this mineral had been
considered a nuisance because, being much heavier than sand, it
tended to separate out with the gold. The new town of Leadville
sprang up near the smelter and shortly afterward more <a class="gloss" href="#g_Lode">lode</a> deposits
were discovered south of the placer workings. From $63,000 in
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
1875, production climbed to $2,500,000 in 1878 and more than
$15,000,000 in the peak year of 1882.</p>
<p>Geologically, the ores of this district occur as Tertiary replacements
and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Vein">veins</a> in Ordovician, Devonian, and Mississippian
limestones. The &ldquo;Blue&rdquo; or Leadville Limestone, of Mississippian
age, contains the richest ore. Ore deposits were formed after the
limestones had been faulted and cracked extensively by mountain-building
movements; the ores themselves probably crystallized
from molten or gaseous materials involved in related igneous intrusions. River gravels and glacial debris mask the true nature
of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Lode">lode</a> deposits, but studies in the mines show that the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fault">fault</a>
systems along which ores are deposited trend north or north-northeast.</p>
<p>The Leadville district is now experiencing its third mining
boom as a newly recognized lead-zinc orebody is being developed.
Production is expected to reach 700 tons of ore per day by 1971.
Total production of gold, silver, lead, zinc, and copper in the
district has reached $500,000,000.</p>
<h3 id="c39">Breckenridge</h3>
<p>Breckenridge was also discovered in 1859, with <a class="gloss" href="#g_Placer">placer</a> gold
the first attraction. The placers gave out in 1862 after about
$3,000,000 in gold had been recovered. Earliest attempts to mine
the rich silver and lead <a class="gloss" href="#g_Vein">veins</a> of the district were in 1869.</p>
<p>As at Leadville, the <a class="gloss" href="#g_SedimentaryRocks">sedimentary rocks</a> of the area were
intruded by granitic masses in Tertiary time, but here the sedimentary rocks are mostly Pennsylvanian sandstones and shales.
These rocks were badly faulted and broken during the intrusion,
and the ores were deposited as the granitic material cooled. The
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Lode">lode</a> deposits occur mostly in small <a class="gloss" href="#g_Vein">veins</a> well hidden by surface
sands and gravels. Some of the veins yielded exceptionally beautiful
crystallized wire and flake gold, specimens of which are on display
at the Colorado School of Mines library in Golden and in the
Denver Museum of Natural History.</p>
<p>Dredging for alluvial gold was attempted in 1898 in the
Breckenridge district, but this method of extracting gold was not
successful until 1905. A number of dredges operated between
1910 and 1925. These floating behemoths shovel up gold-bearing
gravels from the bottom and one side of the pond on which they
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
float, sort out the gold in giant sluiceboxes, and spew out the
leftover gravels in great arc-shaped heaps that can be seen near
Breckenridge and Fairplay and in a number of other valleys in
Colorado. They depend for their operation on a plentiful supply
of water and a shallow water table, but they can sift through
quantities of gravel at relatively low cost. All told, about
$7,000,000 in gold has been dredged from this district.</p>
<h3 id="c40">Fairplay</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig56">
<img src="images/p41.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="569" />
<p class="caption">This gold dredge, still floating in its pond just south of Fairplay,
operated from 1941 to 1952. With chains of buckets like those in
the foreground, it dug gravel 70 feet below water level, carving a
35-foot bank above water level; in effect it mined to a depth of 105
feet. This dredge extracted nearly 115,000 ounces of gold from about
33 million cubic yards of gravel (John Chronic photo)</p>
</div>
<p>Another gold field discovered in 1859 was in the northwest
corner of South Park, along the headwaters of the South Platte
River. Several mining camps were established here. After early
production of rich <a class="gloss" href="#g_Placer">placer</a> deposits, claims were consolidated and
large flumes constructed so that gold could be recovered by
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
hydraulic mining. In this type of mining, streams of water from
high-pressure hoses are directed at gravel surfaces. The gravels
are washed into long sluiceboxes, where gold is caught in riffles.
Hydraulic mining continued upstream from Fairplay until about
1900.</p>
<p>In 1922 a dredge was constructed near Fairplay to process
gravel along the South Platte and in the valley floor. An even
larger dredge, constructed in 1941, operated until 1952, when
rising labor costs overrode the narrow margin on which it operated.
At the time operations ceased, the dredge was recovering about
six cents in gold for each cubic yard of gravel processed.</p>
<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_Placer">Placer</a> gold has always been the principal mineral product of
the Fairplay area, but <a class="gloss" href="#g_NativeGold">native gold</a> also occurs in the surrounding
mountains in quartz <a class="gloss" href="#g_Vein">veins</a>, and many small mines were developed
to extract it. Sulfide ores were also mined; they contained silver,
lead, and zinc as well as gold. In the Mosquito Pass and Horseshoe
Amphitheater areas, there is renewed activity now because
of the recent rise in the price of silver.</p>
<h3 id="c41">Silverton</h3>
<p>Gold was discovered in the San Juan Mountains of southwest
Colorado in 1870. The earliest mine, near what is now Silverton,
was located by a group of prospectors sent out by Governor Pile
of New Mexico Territory. Since the site was on Ute Indian land,
real mining did not begin until a treaty allowing it was ratified in
1874.</p>
<p>Production in the Silverton district has been from <a class="gloss" href="#g_Vein">veins</a> in
Tertiary volcanic rocks within an elliptical area known as the
Silverton cauldron. Here the volcanic rocks, part of the several
thousand feet of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Lava">lava</a> flows and ash falls of the San Juan volcanic
field, were cracked and faulted by a second period of igneous activity. Ores formed in the cracks and fissures.</p>
<p>In the 1870s the Silverton district was very remote, and difficulties
with transportation retarded activity there. In 1882,
however, a narrow-gauge railroad was built connecting Silverton
with Durango, and the problem of transporting ore out of the
isolated mountain valley was simplified. The railway still exists;
a train makes daily passenger runs during the summer&mdash;the only
remaining operating narrow-gauge line in the United States. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
track follows the Animas River canyon, whose cliffs and crags
are dotted with long-abandoned mines, prospect holes, and mine
buildings, monuments to the tenacity and determination of the
men who mined here.</p>
<p>Production in this district was more than $22,000,000 in gold
and $20,000,000 in silver between 1874 and 1923. New activity
is evident here, as in other silver-rich areas of Colorado, because
of recent demand for silver, lead, and zinc.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig57">

<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<h3 id="c42">Ouray</h3>
<p>Ouray was settled in 1875, when gold and silver deposits were
found near Mount Sneffels. Since 1877, mines in Ouray County
have produced over $35,000,000 in gold and $32,000,000 in
silver. The district is still quite active: in 1965, mines in this area
produced more than $9,000,000 in gold, silver, copper, lead, and
zinc, about a third of total Colorado production of these metals
for that year.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig58">

<p>A mile north of Ouray a prominent intrusive <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stock">stock</a> marks the
center of mining activity closest to Ouray. The richest deposits
of the Ouray area, however, lie about five miles southwest, near
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
Mount Sneffels and Red Mountain Creek. There, several large
mines, including the famous Camp Bird mine, have operated for
many years, extracting ore from hundreds of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Vein">veins</a> that underly
the surface. Some of these veins are two to four miles long. They

and calcite are the common <a class="gloss" href="#g_Gangue">gangue</a> (non-economic) minerals,
and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pyrite">pyrite</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sphalerite">sphalerite</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Galena">galena</a>, and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Chalcopyrite">chalcopyrite</a> are the most abundant
ores. Most of the silver is in the galena; gold occurs in
streaks and nodules associated with quartz.</p>
<p>About ten miles south of Ouray, along the &ldquo;Million Dollar
Highway&rdquo; (U. S. 550), the Red Mountain district lies on the
northwest edge of the Silverton volcanic cauldron. It contains a
number of small pipelike bodies very rich in silver-copper and
silver-lead ores. Following the mid-Tertiary volcanism and ore
intrusion, surface rocks in this area were intensely oxidized:
resulting iron oxides now form the gaudy reds and yellows of
Red Mountain and the slopes near Ironton. This alteration, as
well as the fact that much of the area is covered with fallen rock,
stream gravels, or glacial deposits, compounds difficulties of
locating the small though high-grade ore deposits.</p>
<p>The Idarado Mine, on the east side of U. S. highway 550
near Red Mountain, used to produce ores from nearby volcanic
pipes; now it produces from <a class="gloss" href="#g_Vein">veins</a> some distance to the northwest.
The area is honeycombed with tunnels and shafts.</p>
<h3 id="c43">Aspen</h3>
<p>Silver was found at Castle Creek and on Aspen Mountain in
1879. A group of prospectors from Leadville, apparently after
examining maps of the Geological and Geographical Atlas of
Colorado published in 1877, explored along the line of Paleozoic
limestones encircling the Sawatch Range. As they had hoped, they
found ores similar to those at Leadville in rocks of the same age.</p>
<p>Mining began at Aspen in 1880. Here, as at Leadville, intrusion
of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Granite">granite</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Porphyry">porphyry</a> into or near the Leadville Limestone had
broken and deformed the layers, and ores were deposited in
fissures and as replacements during cooling of the intrusions.
The intricacy of faulting which controls the ore pockets in the
limestone is well shown on the map of <a href="#fig15">Aspen Mountain</a> in
Chapter II.</p>
<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_Glaciation">Glaciation</a> occurred in this area, and glacial deposits cover
most of the ore bodies and outcrops so that little <a class="gloss" href="#g_Bedrock">bedrock</a> is
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
exposed. Mapping was accomplished by extrapolating to the
surface the bedrock patterns shown in mine pits, shafts, and
tunnels.</p>
<p>Aspen produced some of the richest silver ores in the world,
and thrived as a boom town for most of two decades. In 1888
the value of ores produced reached over $7,000,000; the next
year it topped $10,000,000. After the silver crash of 1893 production
declined rapidly; the last mines were closed in the 1920s.
Total production of silver, lead, zinc, and copper reached about
$100,000,000. There was virtually no gold in the ores at Aspen.</p>

<p>The Creede district ranks as one of the most productive silver
areas in the United States. It came into being largely as a result
of a discovery by N.H. Creede in 1889. When exploring in this
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
area, he was reported to have exclaimed &ldquo;Holy Moses!&rdquo; on examining
a rich piece of ore, thus giving the name to the mine which
initiated the rapid development of the district. By the end of 1892
the Holy Moses and nearby mines had produced ore valued at
more than $4,000,000. The area was so rich that it managed to
survive 1893&rsquo;s great decline in the price of silver; by 1920 almost
$42,000,000 in gold, silver, lead, and zinc had been mined there.</p>
<p>The ores, silver-bearing <a class="gloss" href="#g_Galena">galena</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sphalerite">sphalerite</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_NativeGold">native gold</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pyrite">pyrite</a>,
and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Chalcopyrite">chalcopyrite</a>, are in quartz or amethyst <a class="gloss" href="#g_Vein">veins</a> in faulted and
shattered Tertiary volcanic rocks. Nearly all the ore deposits lie
along a complex system of vertical <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fault">faults</a>, the Amethyst fault
zone, which runs more or less northwest-southeast through this
region. Both the faulting and the enrichment of the fault fissures
are believed to have taken place in mid-Tertiary time, shortly
after deposition of the volcanic host rocks.</p>

</div>
<p>In 1890, two sheepherders stumbled on some richly mineralized
rocks near Cripple Creek. A boom developed immediately,
for the rocks contained both gold and silver. Since then, the area
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
has produced more than 2,000,000 ounces of silver and nearly
19,000,000 ounces of gold.</p>
<p>Cripple Creek has produced almost half of all the state&rsquo;s gold
and silver. The ores are located in or at the edge of a large mass
of middle Tertiary volcanic rocks which form an elliptical basin
or <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Caldera">caldera</a></i> several miles across. The caldera, surrounded by
Precambrian <a class="gloss" href="#g_Gneiss">gneiss</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Granite">granite</a> of the Pikes Peak <a class="gloss" href="#g_Massif">massif</a>, was
probably formed by collapse of a volcanic center that had erupted
through the older rock. The collapse shattered the rocks around
the basin margin, and subsequent volcanic activity introduced
mineral-rich solutions into the many <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fault">faults</a> and fissures produced
by the collapse. Tellurides of gold, silver, and copper, as well as
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Pyrite">pyrite</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sphalerite">sphalerite</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Galena">galena</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tetrahedrite">tetrahedrite</a>, and other minerals, are

<p>Molybdenum now ranks as the number one metal mined in
Colorado. Over $105,000,000 of &ldquo;moly&rdquo; was mined here during
1969, almost all of it from the Climax Mine, the world&rsquo;s largest
single source of this metal. The Climax deposit is located high
on the west slope of Ten Mile Range in central Colorado, about
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
100 miles southwest of Denver. It is in the central part of the
Colorado mineral belt, near the Mosquito <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fault">Fault</a>, a prominent
structural feature which extends about sixty miles along the north-south
trend of the mountains. Rocks on both sides of this fault
are intruded by Tertiary <a class="gloss" href="#g_Granite">granite</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Dike">dikes</a>, sills, and stocks. The
Climax Mine is in a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stock">stock</a> just east of the fault, near the axis of
a broad <a class="gloss" href="#g_Anticline">anticline</a> in Precambrian metamorphic rocks.</p>
<p>Ore minerals at Climax are <a class="gloss" href="#g_Molybdenite">molybdenite</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Huebnerite">huebnerite</a>, and
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Cassiterite">cassiterite</a>; <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pyrite">pyrite</a> is recovered also for the manufacture of sulfuric
acid. The ore is very low in metal content, containing only one-third
of a percent of molybdenum, 0.005% tungsten trioxide, and
0.0001% tin. The great size of the ore body and efficient recovery
by modern methods make Climax a profitable mine, however.
Production has risen each year since the mine began operation.</p>
<p>Urad Mine near Berthoud Pass is a newly developed near-surface
molybdenum mine similar to Climax. Nearby at the
Henderson Mine the ore body is more than half a mile below
the surface of the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<h3 id="c47">RADIUM, URANIUM, AND VANADIUM</h3>
<p>Over a large area of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Plateau">Plateau</a> Province in western Colorado,
Mesozoic <a class="gloss" href="#g_SedimentaryRocks">sedimentary rocks</a> are locally stained bright yellow,
orange, or green. Such staining suggests mineralization, and radioactive
compounds were recognized here before 1900. At that time,
however, there was little or no market for them or for the vanadium
frequently associated with them. When Marie Curie required
radium for experiments with her newly discovered element, the
raw materials were sent from western Colorado; by and large,
though, production of radium from these ores was prohibitively
expensive.</p>
<p>In 1905, vanadium was found to be effective in toughening
steel. The Vanadium Corporation of America was formed to mine
the Colorado ore. This company mines a rich zone in the Jurassic
Entrada Sandstone, where vanadinite occurs with carnotite and
other uranium ores. In the early days of vanadium mining, the
uranium ores were discarded with other <a class="gloss" href="#g_Gangue">gangue</a> materials; now,
of course, uranium is produced from them.</p>
<p>Since 1945, uranium production has been an important Colorado
industry; in 1969 about $17,500,000 worth was produced.
Uranium occurs in the state in two very different situations. In the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Plateau">Plateau</a> Province, where it was first discovered, it occurs in <a class="gloss" href="#g_SedimentaryRocks">sedimentary rocks</a> as patches of pitchblende, carnotite, and a greenish
yellow mineral called schroekingerite. It is most abundant in the
Triassic Chinle Formation and the Jurassic Entrada and Morrison
Formations, where it was probably deposited by downward movement
of rainwater from overlying uranium-rich Tertiary volcanic
rocks. Concentrations of uranium often occur in or near organic
matter such as coal, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> bone, or petrified wood, so mines tend
to be located along rock layers carrying abundant organic material.</p>
<p>Another type of uranium ore is found in the Mountain
Province. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Vein">Veins</a> in Precambrian rocks of the Front Range and
several other ranges contain pitchblende which seems to have
been deposited by hot groundwater rising through broken and
fissured Precambrian rocks. Often exceedingly rich, such ore is
mined in the manner of most of Colorado&rsquo;s metals. The Schwartzwalder
Mine, a few miles northwest of Golden, has produced more
ore of this type than any other mine in Colorado.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<h3 id="c48">OIL, NATURAL GAS, AND OIL SHALE</h3>
<p>Petroleum and natural gas have been found in large quantities
in the Prairie and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Plateau">Plateau</a> Provinces in Colorado, as well as in
smaller quantities in North Park in the Mountain Province. They
generally occur in porous sandstone and limestone layers, where
they have been trapped by overlying finer-grained, less permeable
layers in or near <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fold">folds</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fault">faults</a>.</p>
<p>Several oil and gas seeps were found along the mountain front
shortly after the arrival of the earliest settlers. Near Canon City,
on Oil Creek, a plaque commemorates the first production:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oil Creek&mdash;site of the first oil well in the west&mdash;second
place in the United States to produce petroleum from wells.
In 1862 ... A. M. Cassedy drilled an oil well 50 feet deep.
By February, 1863, production was one barrel a day.
Later, several thousand gallons of petroleum were produced
by primitive methods, and kerosene and lubricating
oil were shipped by ox team as far as Denver and Santa Fe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About twenty miles to the southeast, near Florence, the
Cretaceous Pierre shales were drilled in 1876. Oil was found in a
system of intersecting fractures and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Joint">joints</a>. Some of the early wells
in the Florence field are still producing, making this Colorado&rsquo;s
oldest and longest producing field. It has yielded more than
10,000,000 barrels of oil.</p>
<p>Small quantities of oil have been produced near Boulder since
about 1900, also from Pierre sandstones and shales. In this area,
wells were located by &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Dowsing">dowsing</a>&rdquo; or &ldquo;witching,&rdquo; as was fashionable
at the time. Several old rigs can be seen near Boulder Reservoir.
As at Florence, oil has been trapped in fractures of otherwise
dense and impervious shale. Some gas is produced and is used
by local farms.</p>
<p>More recently, oil was found far beneath the surface in the
northern part of the Prairie Province. Here, in the Denver Basin,
oil is produced from several levels in the Dakota Sandstone.
The oil has accumulated in lenses of beach sand deposited along
the shoreline of the Cretaceous sea. The general trend of the
shoreline, and of the oil fields, is northeast-southwest. The shore
appears to have been similar to Georgia&rsquo;s present coastline: a
swampy tidal zone separated from open sea by lagoons, sandy
bars, and clean sand beaches.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>Individual oil pools in the Denver Basin are small, but there
are many of them; they lie nearly a mile below the surface, under
much of Morgan and Logan Counties and adjacent parts of
Nebraska. Exploratory and development drilling keeps total oil
production at about 50,000 barrels a day. Oil and gas produced
here is piped to Denver and other Colorado cities.</p>
<p>In southeastern Colorado, oil and gas occur in late Paleozoic
limestones and sandstones similar to those which outcrop at the
edge of the Wet Mountains. Prospecting by geophysical methods
and by drilling has revealed several small, rich accumulations, one
of which is thought to contain about 30,000,000 barrels of oil.</p>
<p>The Rangely field, in northwestern Colorado, is the most
productive field in the state. Located in the northeastern part of
the Uinta Basin, it is an outstanding example of an anticlinal field,
where oil is trapped in a large, gentle <a class="gloss" href="#g_Dome">dome</a>. The shape of the
dome shows up well on the surface; rock layers can be seen
dipping outward in all directions from the town of Rangely. Oil
was found by drilling on the crest of the dome. At first, oil was
produced from fractures in the Cretaceous Mancos Shale at less
than 1,000 feet depth. Later, deeper drilling showed that oil had
also accumulated in the Permian Weber Sandstone, at 5,000 to
7,000 feet. At present this field is producing about 28,000 barrels
of oil a day, but the figure is dropping each year as the field is
depleted.</p>
<p>Oil and gas are produced in southwestern Colorado from the
eastern edge of the Paradox Basin and the northern edge of the San
Juan Basin. In the Paradox Basin, oil comes from Pennsylvanian
limestone mounds or <a class="gloss" href="#g_Reef">reefs</a>. Production in the Colorado part of the
basin has been at most a few thousand barrels per day; more is
produced in adjacent Utah. In the San Juan Basin, gas and oil are
trapped in thin porous layers of Cretaceous and Pennsylvanian
sandstone, between impervious layers of shale. Most of the production
is in New Mexico, although some oil comes from the Colorado
part of the basin.</p>
<p>The greatest known potential oil resource in the world lies in
the oil shales of western Colorado. The richest of these shales
cover an area of 1,600 square miles north of the Colorado River,
south of the White River, and just east of the Colorado-Utah line.
The oil shales are part of the Tertiary Green River Formation,
which extends over much of northwest Colorado, northeast Utah,
and southern Wyoming. Oily material called <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Kerogen">kerogen</a></i> is locked in
these rocks, too solid to flow out of the fine pore spaces of the shale.
To free it the shale must be mined, finely crushed, and heated
until the kerogen converts to liquid oil. This is an expensive
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
process, and as yet production of petroleum from the oil shale has
not been possible at a cost which will compete with production
of oil and gas from wells. The United States Bureau of Mines,
as well as a number of oil companies, have sought for more than
fifty years to discover a less expensive method for extracting oil
from the shale. No doubt at some time in the future a competitive
technique will be developed, or a growing shortage of other oil
will bring world prices to a level with which present production
techniques can compete.</p>
<p>Oil and gas production in Colorado is decreasing at present,
even though great efforts are being made to find new oil pools.
Petroleum prospecting and wildcat drilling are carried out in as
yet unproductive basins in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Plateau">Plateau</a> Province, in intermontane
basins such as the San Luis Valley, and on the Plains. Known
reserves will continue to provide the state with significant income
for many years to come, and if oil shale recovery becomes profitable.
Colorado&rsquo;s hydrocarbons will become the most prominent
of her commodities.</p>
<h3 id="c49">COAL</h3>
<p>Coal resources of Colorado amount to about 60 billion tons.
Only one per cent of this has been mined. Thousands of tons are
now being produced daily from large mines in central, southern,
and northwestern parts of the state.</p>
<p>Colorado&rsquo;s coal deposits were formed during late Cretaceous
and early Tertiary time, when seas were receding from this region
and the land was rising. They represent accumulations of leaves
and other plant material in swamps and flood plains similar to
those now found in the delta of the Mississippi River and in the
swamps of southeastern United States. Almost all Colorado coal is
bituminous or soft coal.</p>
<p>Coal was recognized early in Colorado history by settlers along
the mountain front, and was mined west and north of Denver in the
1860s. Several large underground mines still operate in this district,
supplying local power plants, but production does not compare
with that of the Walsenburg-Trinidad area in southern Colorado
or the Hayden area in northwest Colorado.</p>
<p>The Walsenburg-Trinidad region, part of the Raton coal field,
has produced coal since the building of the Santa Fe Railroad in
the early 1870s. For many years coal from these mines moved
the Santa Fe trains and many of the numerous smaller railroads
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
that served Colorado&rsquo;s cities and mining camps. The location of
the mines helped to determine the location of the Colorado Fuel
and Iron Company smelter in Pueblo. Now, most southern Colorado
coal is used to produce electric power. Many small mines,
miles away from the power plant west of Trinidad, are deserted.</p>
<p>A large coal-burning power plant has recently been built
between Hayden and Steamboat Springs, just west of the Yampa
River. Here, some of the extensive coal deposits can be seen in
road cuts along U. S. highway 40. Until conversion to diesel fuel
became almost universal in North American railroads, mines of
this district produced coal for locomotives.</p>
<p>In the heyday of the gold and silver mines, coal was also mined
near Coalmont, in North Park, and Como, in South Park. Coal
from these areas was used for fuel in nearby mining towns and
ranches, and for the narrow-gauge railroads that penetrated the
mountains here.</p>
<p>At Anthracite, near Crested Butte, high-grade anthracite coal
was mined for a time. Identical in origin with other Colorado coal,
the anthracite of this region was hardened by heat and pressures
from Tertiary igneous intrusions forcing their way into local
<a class="gloss" href="#g_SedimentaryRocks">sedimentary rocks</a> during post-Cretaceous mountain building.</p>
<p>A multitude of other coal camps are scattered about Colorado:
Cokedale, Delcarbon, Coaldale, Roncarbo, Carbondale, and
Cardiff stand out because of their suggestive names. These early
small camps are, like their metal-mine cousins, largely deserted
today.</p>
<h3 id="c50">CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS</h3>
<h3 id="c51">Sand, Gravel, and Clay</h3>
<p>Sand, gravel, and crushed rock rate high among geologic
products in Colorado; more than $27,000,000 worth of these
materials were produced in the state in 1969. Highway and
construction activities have brought recent expansion in the number
and size of quarries and gravel pits. Increasingly, Coloradoans
are insisting that quarries and pits be excavated only where they
will not mar the natural beauty of the landscape, and many old
pits are now being filled in. Unfortunately, the scars left by some
quarries&mdash;such as that on the Rampart Range near Colorado
Springs&mdash;are difficult to erase.</p>
<p>Clay of good quality occurs in Cretaceous deposits in many
parts of Colorado, most frequently in the Dakota or Laramie
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
Formations. In the area around Golden, the Coors Porcelain
Company for many years mined clay for use in pottery and low
temperature ceramic ware. Scars from this mining can be seen
along the mountain front north and south of Golden, and deep
clefts within the town, just west of Colorado School of Mines,
testify to the amounts of clay that have been removed. Colorado
clay is not pure enough to be used in high temperature ceramics,
and the present use for it is in the manufacture of common tiles
and bricks.</p>
<p>A recent development in Colorado is the use of Cretaceous
Pierre shales in manufacturing lightweight aggregate for building.
The shale is mined between Golden and Boulder, near Colorado
highway 93. In the nearby plant, it is pulverized and then heated
in a large rotating cylinder until the surface of each particle fuses.
Then the particles are quickly cooled. The resulting product is
much like cinder, light in weight and yet strong. It can be mixed
with cement for use in construction work requiring a great
strength-to-weight ratio, or made into concrete blocks.</p>

<h3 id="c52">Stone</h3>
<p>In Colorado, as in most parts of the world, building stone for
local use is quarried locally. Two of the state&rsquo;s stones, however&mdash;Yule
Marble from the Crystal River Canyon, and Lyons Sandstone
of the Front Range&mdash;have been more widely used.</p>
<p>The Yule Marble, or Yule Colorado Marble, was produced by
metamorphism of Leadville Limestone in an area intruded by the
Treasure Mountain <a class="gloss" href="#g_Granite">Granite</a>, thirty-five miles south of Glenwood
Springs. This exquisite marble, which has graced many famous
monuments and buildings (among them the Lincoln Memorial
and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier), is known for its almost
uniform snowy whiteness and regular, fine crystallization. Although
its beauty, massive character, and uniformity made it a sought-after
ornamental stone, quarrying was economically marginal
because of the remoteness of the site. In spite of this, nearly
$7,000,000 worth of the marble was produced before the quarry
closed in 1940.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig63">
<img src="images/p45a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="523" />
<p class="caption">Pure white marble was quarried for many years at the Yule Colorado
Marble Quarry, about three miles southeast of the village of Marble.

</div>
<p>The Lyons area, north of Boulder, provides pink, hard, even-grained
sandstone which splits readily into slabs or flagstones.
These are used in the Denver-Boulder area for sidewalks and
patios as well as for facing buildings. Quarries owned by the
University of Colorado provide a constant supply of handsome
facing material and flagstone for new university buildings, although
in recent years the high cost of stone construction has limited its
use on the campus.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>The Lyons Sandstone was deposited as beach and bar sand
along the edge of a sea which lay east of the Front Range in
Permian time. After deposition, the sand was deeply buried and
compacted. Now tilted up along the Front Range uplift, it comes
to the surface along the east side of the range. Only between
Fort Collins and Boulder does the stone have the desirable combination
of hardness, thin-beddedness, and color which makes it
desirable for ornamental use. The pink color of the Lyons Sandstone
is derived from iron oxides, mostly <a class="gloss" href="#g_Hematite">hematite</a>, disseminated
between the sand grains. Dendrites (often erroneously called

<h3 id="c53">Lime and Gypsum</h3>
<p>Outcrops of the Cretaceous Greenhorn and Niobrara Limestones
provide most of the cement materials in Colorado. A number
of plants along the mountain front, including a completely automated
and dust-free one near Lyons, provide the major population
centers with millions of tons of cement each year.</p>
<p>Colorado is richly endowed with gypsum, useful in cement and
plaster manufacture and for ornamental stone and sculpture.
Along the eastern front of the mountains, gypsum occurs in the
Triassic Lykins Formation; in the Mountain Province, it is abundant
in Pennsylvanian <a class="gloss" href="#g_SedimentaryRocks">sedimentary rocks</a>. Particularly high-quality
Pennsylvanian gypsum is quarried at the town of Gypsum, west
of Eagle.</p>
<p>The Colorado portion of the Paradox Basin, in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Plateau">Plateau</a>
Province, contains immense deposits of Pennsylvanian gypsum.
Here, rocks near the surface have been pushed up into sharp
northwest-trending faulted <a class="gloss" href="#g_Anticline">anticlines</a> by upward movements of
gypsum and salt from depths of several thousands of feet. The
soluble salt and gypsum cores of these structures have been
washed away more rapidly than the surrounding layers of sandstone
and shale, leaving depressions such as Gypsum Valley,
Paradox Valley, and Sinbad Valley, on the crests of the anticlines.

Chinle Formation and the Wingate Sandstone, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Dip">dip</a> away from these

valleys. Exploratory wells indicate that vast masses of salt and
gypsum are present beneath the surface, and may extend to depths
greater than 10,000 feet.</p>
<h3 id="c54">GEMS AND ORNAMENTAL STONES</h3>
<p>More than thirty different gems and ornamental stones are
known to occur in Colorado. Amazonstone, amethyst, garnet,
tourmaline, aquamarine, topaz, lapis lazuli, quartz crystal, smoky
and rose quartz, sapphire, several varieties of agate, zircon, and
other attractive stones are gathered within the state, mainly in the
Mountain Province. Turquoise is known at several places in
the volcanic area of southern Colorado. Alabaster is mined
along the northeastern mountain front near Fort Collins and
Loveland. Localities of interest to gem hunters are described in
<i>Colorado Gem Trails and Mineral Guide</i>, by Richard M. Pearl.</p>
<p>Gem Village, in southwestern Colorado on U. S. highway 160
between Durango and Pagosa Springs, is a favorite stopping place
for tourists wishing to see or buy colorful and attractive Colorado
stones such as petrified wood, agatized dinosaur bones, chalcedony,
and jasper.</p>

<h3 id="c55">WATER</h3>
<p>Although not all aspects of water and water supply are
geologic, water is an important geologic agent, determining the
shape of the surface, the distribution of minerals, and the location
of caves. Water used in Colorado comes entirely from precipitation
within the state, as all of Colorado&rsquo;s rivers flow from
Colorado outward toward the surrounding lower-elevation states.</p>
<h3 id="c56">Surface Water</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig66">
<img src="images/p47.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="495" />
<p class="caption">A cross section through the Front Range northwest of Denver shows
the redistribution and use of western slope water in eastern Colorado
through the Colorado-Big Thompson Project. This project has cost
about $160,000,000, but it is repaying the investment many times
over by providing electric power and increasing farm production.</p>
</div>
<p>Moisture carried by prevailing westerly or northwesterly winds
falls primarily on Colorado&rsquo;s western slope, although at some
times of year precipitation may come from the northeast or
southeast. West of the continental divide, where population is
sparse, there is a surplus of water. East of the divide, where more
than 90 per cent of the population lives, water is in desperately
short supply. The high and largely unpopulated Mountain Province
receives by far the greatest proportion of precipitation, while
agricultural areas of the Prairie and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Plateau">Plateau</a> Provinces receive
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
much less. Needless to say, the major problem involving water
in Colorado is how to move it from areas where it is abundant
to areas where it is needed.</p>
<p>In many parts of the state, complex water laws and complicated
irrigation canals and water systems were developed soon
after the area became settled. Gradually but inevitably, water
resources have been transferred from the western slope to the
eastern. However, such transfer must be undertaken with due
regard for the rights of downstream users, notably California,
Arizona, and New Mexico.</p>
<p>One of the largest water movement schemes in the state is the
Colorado-Big Thompson Project. Water that otherwise would flow
into the Colorado River is piped from Grand Lake through the
Alva B. Adams tunnel under the high mountains of Rocky
Mountain National Park, and into the Big Thompson drainage
near Estes Park. It then travels through a series of reservoirs and
tunnels into the South Platte River basin, where it is used for
irrigation and household water. The water is pumped up the
western gradient of this system by electric power produced as it
flows down the eastern slope. Surplus electric power serves the
Colorado-Wyoming area.</p>
<p>Another large project is the Denver Water Board&rsquo;s Dillon
Reservoir Project, in which western slope water collected at
Dillon is pumped twenty-three miles under the continental divide
through the Harold D. Roberts tunnel to the North Fork of the
South Platte River for use by the city of Denver. The exit point
of this tunnel can be seen a few miles west of Grant along U. S.
highway 285. This project is continuously growing as Denver&rsquo;s
water needs mount.</p>
<p>In each of these projects, engineering geologists played a
prominent part in locating dams and tunnels that would not leak
or fail, and that could collect and transport a maximum amount
of water during the high-runoff spring season for distribution
through the rest of the year. Fortunately for geologists, the tunnels
and bores necessary to the projects allowed them to learn a great
deal about the structure of the interior of the high mountains, and
helped to improve their interpretation of earth history in this most
interesting region.</p>
<p>The necessity for storing irrigation water along the eastern
mountain front has led to the creation of hundreds of new lakes
in the region. Although water levels vary with the season, many
of the lakes provide opportunities for water sports and recreation
for the burgeoning inland population.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>Two large dams have recently been built in western Colorado
for another purpose: to control the flow of water in the Colorado
River drainage basin. Electric power for western Colorado also
comes from these dams. One of the dams is on the Gunnison
River at Curecanti, upstream from the Black Canyon of the
Gunnison National Monument, and the other is on the Frying Pan
River near Ruedi. The latter was completed over the objections
of geologists, who believed that the extensive gypsum deposits
underlying the damsite would cause its failure. Cement pumped
deep into the rocks in the vicinity has so far prevented serious
rupture.</p>
<p>There is strong resistance by conservation groups to the construction
of more dams on Colorado River drainage, primarily
because the Colorado and its tributaries pass through many
irreplaceable canyons, some of them parts of National Parks and
Monuments, that are very much a part of our western heritage.</p>

<p class="caption">In the San Luis Valley, runoff from the San Juan and Sangre de Cristo

<p>Groundwater is extremely important to Colorado, especially
in the Prairie Province and the San Luis Valley. Below these two
areas lie a number of distinct and productive groundwater <a class="gloss" href="#g_Aquifer">aquifers</a>,
several of them artesian. In Otero County, for example, there are
five major aquifers: three separate Quaternary gravel deposits,
the Cretaceous Dakota Sandstone, and the Cheyenne Sandstone
Member of the Purgatoire Formation, also Cretaceous. All these
aquifers are characterized by their high porosity and permeability,
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
which allow water to flow rapidly through them. Wells in the
younger, shallower aquifers produce as much as 2,000 gallons
per minute; those in the older, deeper aquifers produce about
eighty gallons per minute, some of it with an artesian &ldquo;head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The San Luis Valley supports intensive agriculture, made
possible by a great <a class="gloss" href="#g_ArtesianWater">artesian water</a> supply. A thick series of soft
interlayered clays and sands, the Alamosa Formation, slopes down
toward the center of the basin from the surrounding mountains.
Water entering the sandstone beds at the mountain edges flows
through the sand layers held there by the impermeable clay beds.
By the time it reaches the center of the valley, it has developed
considerable hydrostatic head, and the water rises in wells without
pumping. Unfortunately, both the irrigation water and the soils
in the San Luis Valley are highly alkaline. Constant evaporation
from the irrigated fields has concentrated the alkali near and on
the surface, rendering some of the land less usable than it was
originally.</p>
<h3 id="c58">Caves</h3>
<p>Colorado has many caves, most of them carved by underground
water in Paleozoic limestone. The Cave of the Winds at
Manitou is the only one in the state which has been developed as
a tourist attraction. It is in highly faulted Ordovician and Mississippian
limestone near the mountain front, where the faulting,
coupled with the high relief, has accelerated solution of the rock
by allowing groundwater to percolate downward rapidly. The
cavern was probably carved during the Pleistocene Ice Age, when
surface water and groundwater were much more abundant than
at present. Deposition of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stalactite">stalactites</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stalagmite">stalagmites</a> has occurred
within the last few thousand years, as supplies and movement of
water have decreased.</p>
<p>Spanish Cave, above timberline on Marble Mountain in the
Sangre de Cristo Range, is probably the nation&rsquo;s highest limestone
cave. It is in thick folded and faulted Pennsylvanian <a class="gloss" href="#g_Reef">reef</a> limestone,
at an elevation of over 12,000 feet. The cave has many
intricate passageways branching from its main vertical tubes and
channels.</p>
<p>Fulford Cave, south of Eagle, is in the Mississippian Leadville
Limestone of the northern part of the Sawatch Range. Many other
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
caves are situated south of Fulford, near Woods Lake, where the
limestone is widely exposed and highly dissected.</p>
<p>Fairy Cave, northeast of Glenwood Springs, is the best known
of the many caverns in the Paleozoic limestones that form the
southern flanks of the White River <a class="gloss" href="#g_Plateau">Plateau</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>In the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Plateau">Plateau</a> Province another type of cave is formed not
so much by groundwater as by weathering of the flat-lying alternating
beds of massive resistant sandstone and less resistant, thinly
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
bedded mudstone and shale. Where the resistant layers are undermined,
great arching caves develop. These are best observed at
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesa">Mesa</a> Verde National Park, where many of them once sheltered
Indian communities. They can also be seen in Colorado National
Monument and along the Colorado River and several of its major
tributaries.</p>

<h3 id="c59">Springs</h3>
<p>The multitudes of mineral and hot springs in Colorado are a
fascinating and interesting facet of the Mountain Province. Some
are located along major <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fault">faults</a>, where the rocks are so broken and
shattered that groundwater can move freely toward the surface.
Colorado Springs, Manitou Springs, and Eldorado Springs are on
the fault complex that forms the east edge of the Front Range.
Glenwood, Juniper, Steamboat, and Poncha Springs are on well
defined faults also.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig70">

<p class="caption">Glenwood Hot Springs flow from Pennsylvanian shales of the Belden

hotel and on the right can be seen the Mississippian Leadville Limestone,
cut by the Colorado River. (From a painting by William H.
Jackson, courtesy of Colorado State Archives and Public Record)</p>
</div>
<p>Many other springs do not seem to be controlled so strongly
by faulting, but owe their presence to sources of volcanic or magmatic
heat which exist near to the surface of the ground. Some
springs of this type issue from Precambrian <a class="gloss" href="#g_Granite">granite</a>, or Cenozoic
volcanic rock, while others flow from sedimentary rock layers.
Waunita Hot Springs and Pagosa Springs, although near volcanic
rocks, reach the surface through porous sandstones and shales of
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
Cretaceous age. Mt. Princeton Hot Springs comes from <a class="gloss" href="#g_Alluvium">alluvium</a>
but its heat source is the intrusive igneous rock which makes up
part of the adjacent mountain.</p>
<p>Springs of another general type are also present in Colorado
where <a class="gloss" href="#g_Aquifer">aquifers</a>, generally sandstones, are dissected by erosion.
These springs, usually not highly mineralized or warm, are most
often found in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Plateau">Plateau</a> Province. Such springs are frequent at
the bases of the great sandstone cliffs of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesa">Mesa</a> Verde and Colorado
National Monument.</p>
<p>Manitou&rsquo;s carbonated springs, which attract many tourists,
have their origin in the arrangement and nature of the rocks
through which the water flows. Water from the Pikes Peak region,
slightly acid from its contact with the granitic rock, flows into the
Manitou limestone all along Ute Pass <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fault">fault</a>, which extends from
Cheyenne Mountain northwest to Woodland Park. Descending
through channels along the fault, the water becomes pressurized.
Because of its pressure and its acid content, it partly dissolves
the calcium carbonate of the limestone, and from then on carries
carbon dioxide in solution. As the water comes to the surface at
the low point of the fault exposure, near the west edge of Manitou,
the pressure is released and the carbon dioxide effervesces, just
as a bottle of soda water effervesces when the cap is removed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<h3 id="c60">ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY</h3>
<p>The preceding part of this chapter mentions many ways
in which man&rsquo;s destiny in Colorado has been shaped by
geologic factors. Early Coloradoans settled near gold and silver
placers, later ones near mines that produced ores of other
metals, or in the towns that sprang up around the mills and
smelters that processed these ores. Our present distribution of
population is partly a heritage from these first settlements, partly
a result of later discoveries of oil, gas, and radioactive minerals,
and partly a response to the state&rsquo;s extreme topographic variation,
which controls and delineates agricultural areas and transportation
routes.</p>
<p>In recent years, man has begun to appreciate the fact that he
may benefit in other ways from knowledge about geology. A new
geology has developed&mdash;<i>environmental geology</i>&mdash;which may be
defined as the total of all geological conditions and influences
affecting the life and development of man.</p>
<p>Environmental geology is a broad science, concerned not only
with the location of cities and towns, but with the uses people
make of the land and its economic products, and with the relationship
between the geological character of the land and the present
and future location of roads, dams, bridges, factories, homes,
recreation facilities, sanitary land fills, and even sewage plants.</p>
<p>Two aspects of environmental geology which are particularly
pertinent to Colorado&rsquo;s residents are discussed below.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>Landslides</i> and slumping rock or earth are a frequent menace
to Colorado&rsquo;s development in the Mountain Province. Often
activated by heavy rains or deep manmade cuts, they can cause&mdash;and
<i>have</i> caused&mdash;much damage to roads, buildings, and other
works of man.</p>
<p>The flanks of North and South Table Mountains, near Golden,
are mantled by thick landslide debris; intermittent movement of
the individual slides has repeatedly affected the railroad, irrigation
ditches, and roads. As many as six different slides have moved
within a single year. In one slide area, asphalt road material is
estimated to be thirteen feet thick; successive layers of pavement
have been laid one on top of another to keep the street up to grade.</p>
<p>Landslides and landslide-prone areas may not be obvious to
the untrained eye. Each year buildings and roads are constructed
on unsuitable rock and soil foundations, in places where some
degree of land slip is almost inevitable. Building in such areas
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
is risky, but sometimes worth the risk; if condition are less than
ideal, risks can be reduced by specialized types of construction.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>Floods</i> are a perennial threat to much of the state, because
of the high relief of the drainage basins and the torrential nature
of the spring and summer rainfall. Their damaging effects were
realized early in Colorado&rsquo;s history, when canyons were used as
highways and railroad routes.</p>
<p>Colorado&rsquo;s most expensive flood was probably the flood in
the South Platte River basin south of Denver in 1965, which
caused $508,000,000 worth of damage and drowned six people.
The losses can be attributed to man&rsquo;s failure to realize the significance
of the South Platte drainage routes and flood plains. Homes,
shopping centers, and many other buildings occupied&mdash;and still
occupy, as of 1971&mdash;land that has been intermittently flooded
for many years. The following description of this flood, by H. F.
Matthai of the U. S. Geological Survey, may help to convey some
warning to residents or potential residents of the South Platte
valley and other river valleys in Colorado:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The morning of June 16 was most pleasant, but conditions
changed rapidly shortly before noon. A tornado touched ground
15 miles south southeast of Denver about 1 p.m. Within the next
hour, another unroofed 30 homes in the little town of Palmer
Lake, 40 miles south of Denver. About 2 p.m., a dense mass of
clouds descended and concealed the top of Dawson Butte, 7 miles
southwest of Castle Rock; and the little light remaining faded
until it was dark black and frightening, according to some people.
A nearby rancher&rsquo;s wife described the intense quiet as awesome,
but the calm did not last very long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The deluge began, not only near Dawson Butte, but also at
Raspberry Mountain, 6 miles to the south, near Larkspur. The
rain came down harder than any rain the local residents had ever
seen, and the temperature dropped rapidly until it was cold.
The quiet was shattered by the terrible roar of wind, rain, and
rushing water. Then the thudding of huge boulders, the snapping
and tearing of trees, and the grinding of cobbles and gravel
increased the tumult. The small natural channels on the steep
slopes could not carry the runoff; so water took shortcuts, following
the line of least resistance. Creeks overflowed, roads became
rivers, and fields became lakes&mdash;all in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The flow from glutted ravines and from fields and hillsides
soon reached East and West Plum Creeks. The combined flow
in these creeks have been described as awesome, fantastic, and
unbelievable; yet none of these superlatives seem adequate to
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
describe what actually occurred. Large waves, high velocities,
crosscurrents, and eddies swept away trees, houses, bridges, automobiles,
heavy construction equipment, and livestock. All sorts
of debris and large volumes of sand and gravel were torn from the
banks and beds of the streams and were dumped, caught, plastered,
or buried along the channel and flood plains downstream. A local
resident stated, &lsquo;The banks of the creek disappeared as if the land
was made of sugar.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The flood reached the South Platte River and the urban areas
of Littleton, Englewood, and Denver about 8 p.m. Here the rampaging
waters picked up house trailers, large butane storage tanks,
lumber, and other flotsam and smashed them against bridges and
structures near the river. Many of the partly plugged bridges could
not withstand the added pressure and washed out. Other bridges
held, but they forced water over approach fills, causing extensive
erosion. The flood plains carried and stored much of the flood
water, which inundated many homes, businesses, industries, railroad
yards, highways, and streets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The flood peak passed through Denver during the night, and
the immediate crisis was over by morning; but those in the inundated
areas were faced with a Herculean task. The light of day
revealed the nature of the destruction&mdash;mud in every nook and
cranny, soggy merchandise, warped bowling alleys, drowned
animals, the loss of irreplaceable possessions, to name a few types.
The colossal cleanup job, which would take months, began.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hydrogeological studies by the U. S. Geological Survey and
Corps of Engineers give knowledgeable estimates of flood danger
for different populated areas of the state, and recommend that
homes, roads, and other structures be placed above likely flood
levels.</p>
